# SOP-302: Keyword Optimization

**Nurise Listing Optimization**

---

## Purpose
Add missing keywords to your listing copy, convert broad matches to exact matches, and improve overall keyword coverage while maintaining readability.

## When to Use
- After completing listing analysis (SOP-301)
- Addressing specific keyword gaps
- Improving SEO Leaderboard position
- Preparing listing updates

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Listing analysis complete (SOP-301)
- [ ] Gap list documented with priorities
- [ ] Access to Listing Builder
- [ ] Understanding of current listing structure

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Review Your Gap List
Open your documented gaps from SOP-301:
- HIGH priority gaps (tackle first)
- MEDIUM priority gaps (if time allows)
- Focus on 1-2 changes per optimization session

**Critical Rule:**
> Make only 1-2 keyword changes at a time, then wait 3-5 days before making more changes.

### Step 2: Understand Keyword Placement Value
Where you place keywords matters:

| Location | SEO Weight | Best For |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Title | Highest | Top 2-3 keywords |
| Bullets | High | Supporting keywords |
| Description | Medium | Long-tail variations |
| Backend | Low | Overflow keywords |

### Step 3: Convert Broad to Exact Match
For keywords showing "Broad Match":

**Before (Broad):**
```
Title: "Replacement Cartridge Filter for Type VI Hot Tub Spa"
Keyword: "type vi hot tub filter" = Broad match
```

**After (Exact):**
```
Title: "Type VI Hot Tub Filter - Replacement Cartridge for Spa..."
Keyword: "type vi hot tub filter" = Exact match
```

**Technique:**
1. Identify the exact keyword phrase needed
2. Rearrange existing words to create exact phrase
3. Maintain readability and compliance

### Step 4: Add Missing Keywords
For keywords not in copy at all:

**4a. Find Natural Placement**
- Read current copy
- Identify where keyword fits naturally
- Don't force awkward phrasing

**4b. Example Addition:**
```
GAP: "bestway saluspa filter replacement"

Original Bullet:
"Premium hot tub filter cartridge with trilobal filtration"

Updated Bullet:
"Premium Bestway SaluSpa filter replacement cartridge with trilobal filtration"
```

### Step 5: Use the AI Copywriter (Optional)
If making larger changes or creating from scratch:

1. In Listing Builder, click **AI Copywriter**
2. Select mode:
   - **Cosmo/Rufus** - New algorithm optimized
   - **Classic** - Traditional keyword-focused
3. Generate content
4. Review coverage automatically

**When to Use AI:**
- Creating new listings from scratch
- Major overhaul needed
- Want to see optimal keyword placement

**When NOT to Use AI:**
- Minor tweaks to existing listing
- Just adding 1-2 keywords
- Want to preserve brand voice

### Step 6: Test Keyword Value
Before finalizing, verify keyword matters:

**Point System Test:**
1. Note current point score
2. Remove the text you're considering
3. Check if score changes:
   - **Score drops** = Text has SEO value (keep it)
   - **Score unchanged** = Not SEO-relevant (can modify)

**Example:**
```
Text: "fits Coleman SaluSpa and Lay-Z-Spa models"
Before removal: 122 points
After removal: 122 points
Conclusion: Phrase has no SEO value for your MKL
```

### Step 7: Avoid Keyword Skewing
Don't add irrelevant high-volume keywords:

**Warning Signs:**
- Score jumps dramatically after adding keyword
- Keyword doesn't match your product type
- SERP for keyword shows different products

**Example of Skewing:**
```
Product: Type VI Hot Tub Filter
Bad addition: "pool pump" (high volume but wrong product)
Result: False #1 SEO ranking, won't help actual sales
```

### Step 8: Review Final Copy
Before saving, verify:

- [ ] Exact matches for priority keywords
- [ ] Copy still reads naturally
- [ ] No compliance issues
- [ ] Within character limits
- [ ] Brand voice maintained

**Character Limits:**
| Field | Limit |
|-------|-------|
| Title | 200 characters |
| Bullets | 500 characters each |
| Description | 2,000 characters |
| Backend | 250 bytes |

### Step 9: Document Changes Made
Record what you changed:

```
Date: [Date]
ASIN: [ASIN]

Changes Made:
1. Title: Added "type vi hot tub filter" as exact match
2. Bullet 1: Added "bestway saluspa" phrase

Keywords Addressed:
- type vi hot tub filter (Broad → Exact)
- bestway saluspa filter replacement (Missing → Added)

SEO Score: [Before] → [After]
Leaderboard: #[X] → #[Y]
```

### Step 10: Prepare for Implementation
Your optimized copy is ready for:
- SOP-303: Listing Update Process
- Implementation in Seller Central
- Monitoring with Rank Radar
