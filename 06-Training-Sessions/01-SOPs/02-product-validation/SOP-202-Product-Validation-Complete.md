---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Open the Product Scorecard
1. From your dive, click **Product Scorecard**
2. The scorecard will guide you through each question
3. Keep the MKL and dive open in another tab for reference

### Step 2: Analyze Root Keywords
Navigate to the **Roots** tab to count keyword roots:

1. Look for 2+ word phrases that describe the product
2. Count how many relevant root keywords exist:

| Root Count | Score |
|------------|-------|
| 7+ roots | Excellent |
| 4-6 roots | Good |
| 2-3 roots | Fair |
| <2 roots | Poor |

**Example for "Beef Liver Supplements":**
```
✓ beef liver
✓ liver supplements
✓ organ supplements
✓ beef organs
✓ desiccated liver
= 5 roots (Good)
```

3. **Important:** Note the percentage shown (e.g., 64%) - you'll need this for the scorecard

### Step 3: Count Relevant Keywords
Check your filtered MKL count:

| Keyword Count | Assessment |
|---------------|------------|
| 200+ keywords | Large market |
| 100-199 keywords | Good market |
| 50-99 keywords | Smaller market |
| <50 keywords | Niche/risky |

### Step 4: Assess Profitability
Answer the scorecard questions about profitability:

**4a. Product Longevity**
- Will this product be relevant in 5+ years?
- Hair products, supplements = typically yes
- Trend-based products = be cautious

**4b. Estimated ROI**
- Default to 100% if unsure
- Get manufacturer quotes for accuracy
- Consider: unit cost, shipping, Amazon fees

**Quick Quote Method:**
1. Search Alibaba for product
2. Note price ranges
3. Compare to Amazon selling price
4. Rough margin calculation

### Step 5: Score Product Potential
Answer these scorecard questions:

| Factor | Yes = Points | No = 0 |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Can save on packaging? | + | 0 |
| Can save on fulfillment? | + | 0 |
| Have a patent/proprietary? | + | 0 |
| Unique design possible? | + | 0 |
| Can add features/blend? | + | 0 |

**Competition Factor:**
- 4+ competitors selling same product = Higher risk
- Adjust scoring if you're aware of competition level

### Step 6: Evaluate Competitiveness

**6a. Review Count Analysis**
Go back to MKL and check competitor reviews:

| Pattern | Risk Level |
|---------|------------|
| Most have <1,000 reviews | Lower barrier |
| Several have 1,000-10,000 | Moderate |
| Many have 10,000+ | High barrier |
| Some have 50,000+ | Very established |

Count how many of top 10 have 1,000+ reviews.

**6b. Calculate SEO Strength**
Look at the 60% and 80% columns in MKL:
1. Add together: `60% count + 80% count`
2. This shows how many competitors dominate page 1

| Combined Score | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| 10+ | Very competitive |
| 6-9 | Moderately competitive |
| <6 | Opportunity exists |

**6c. Check for 1P (Amazon) Sellers**
Look for "AMZ" in the seller column:
- 0 Amazon sellers = Normal for niche
- 1-2 Amazon sellers = Amazon sees opportunity
- 3+ Amazon sellers = Established market

### Step 7: Review Market Trends

**7a. Google Trends**
Check the Google Trends section in the dive:

| Trend | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| Going up | Growing demand |
| Flat/stable | Consistent market |
| Seasonal spikes | Plan inventory accordingly |
| Declining | Caution |

**7b. Seasonality**
- Is this a year-round product?
- Note any Q4/holiday spikes
- Adjust if highly seasonal

### Step 8: Check Variations & Brands

**Variations:**
Look at variation counts in MKL:
- 1-3 variations = Simple market
- 4-5 variations = Some complexity
- 6+ variations = Complex, may need multiple SKUs

**Major Brands:**
Count recognizable brands in top 10:
- 0-2 major brands = Lower competition
- 3-4 major brands = Moderate
- 5+ major brands = Brand-dominated

### Step 9: Review Listing Builder Coverage
1. Go to **Listing Builder**
2. Check how many competitors have exact match keywords
3. Question: Do 5+ have 3+ top keywords in exact match?

**Warning Sign:**
If Listing Builder shows empty coverage for main keywords, the product may be restricted or competitors are avoiding certain terms.

### Step 10: Save and Score
1. Complete all scorecard questions
2. Review the final score:

| Score | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| Positive (high) | Strong candidate |
| Positive (low) | Worth considering |
| Negative | Higher risk, investigate further |
| Very negative | Likely pass |

3. Save the dive with updated label:
   - `Validated - Go`
   - `Validated - Maybe`
   - `Validated - Pass`
