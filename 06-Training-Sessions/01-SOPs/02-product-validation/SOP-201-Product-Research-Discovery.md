**Nurise Listing Optimization**

---

## Purpose
Find potential products to validate by searching Amazon categories with specific criteria, preparing the initial keyword list for deeper analysis.

## When to Use
- Starting new product research
- Expanding into new categories
- Looking for higher-margin opportunities

## Prerequisites
- [ ] DataDive account set up (SOP-101)
- [ ] Amazon Seller Central connected
- [ ] Target category or niche identified

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Select Search Strategy
Choose your approach based on goals:

| Strategy | Best For | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Price Point | Higher margins | Supplements > $40 |
| Category Browse | Exploring niches | Sports Nutrition |
| Competitor ASIN | Copying success | Top seller's catalog |

### Step 2: Search Amazon with Filters
1. Go to Amazon and select your target category
2. Apply price filters:
   - **Recommended:** $30+ for better margins
   - Avoid $5-8 range (low margin)
3. Sort by "Avg. Customer Review" or "Best Sellers"
4. Scroll through results looking for:
   - Products with good reviews but not overwhelming (1,000-10,000)
   - Clear product differentiation opportunity
   - Price points that suggest profitability

### Step 3: Select Products to Validate
As you browse, open interesting products in new tabs:
- Look for 5-10 candidates per research session
- Note variety (don't pick all the same type)
- Consider seasonality and trends

**Quick Assessment Questions:**
- Is this a consumable or repurchase product?
- Can I source this reliably?
- Is there room for differentiation?

### Step 4: Launch DataDive on Product
1. Copy the ASIN from the product page
2. Go to DataDive → **Niche Pipeline**
3. Click **New Dive**
4. Paste the ASIN
5. Click **Start Dive**
6. Wait for research to complete (1-2 minutes)

### Step 5: Initial MKL Cleanup
Once dive completes, prepare the Master Keyword List (MKL):

**5a. Remove Brand Names**
1. Click the **"B"** button (brand filter)
2. This excludes branded search terms
3. Focus remains on generic keywords

**5b. Set Search Volume Threshold**
1. Find the **Minimum Relevancy** slider
2. Set to **450** (recommended starting point)
3. Low-volume keywords move to Residue bucket

**5c. Remove Inconsistent Product Types**
If you see keywords for different products:
```
Example: Diving "Omega 3 Capsules"
Remove keywords containing: "powder", "liquid", "gummy"
```
Use **Not Contains** filter to clean

### Step 6: Quick Relevancy Check
Scroll through the filtered MKL:
- Do keywords match your intended product?
- Are there enough keywords (100+ is good)?
- Note the search volume distribution

**Red Flags:**
- Less than 50 relevant keywords
- All keywords very low volume
- Keywords don't match product type

### Step 7: Name and Save the Dive
1. Click the dive name to edit
2. Use naming convention:
   ```
   [Category] - [Product Type] - [Date]
   Example: Supplements - Omega 3 Capsules - 2026-01
   ```
3. Assign to appropriate Space
4. Add initial label: `To Validate`

### Step 8: Repeat for Multiple Products
- Aim for 5-10 dives per research session
- Build a pool of candidates
- Validate the best ones using SOP-202
