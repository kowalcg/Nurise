# SOP-203: Pipeline Management

**Nurise Listing Optimization**

---

## Purpose
Organize validated products in your pipeline, compare scores, calculate profitability, and prioritize which products to pursue.

## When to Use
- After validating 10+ products (SOP-202)
- Comparing opportunities across your pipeline
- Deciding which products to source/launch
- Preparing for manufacturer quotes

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Multiple products validated (SOP-202)
- [ ] Products saved to appropriate Spaces
- [ ] Scorecard data complete for each product

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Access Your Pipeline
1. Go to **Niche Pipeline** in DataDive
2. Select the Space containing your validated products
3. Review the list view showing all dives

### Step 2: Review Score Comparison
The pipeline view shows key metrics for comparison:

| Column | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| Score | Overall validation score |
| Search Volume | Total keyword volume |
| Competitor Strength | How tough the competition is |
| Review Count | Average competitor reviews |

**Sort by Score** to see highest-potential products first.

### Step 3: Apply Labels for Status
Update labels based on validation results:

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Strong Candidate` | High score, worth pursuing |
| `Getting Quotes` | Sent to manufacturers |
| `Quotes Received` | Have pricing, need decision |
| `Ready to Launch` | Green light, preparing launch |
| `On Hold` | Good but not now |
| `Passed` | Decided against |

### Step 4: Use Profits Calculator
For top candidates, enter profitability data:

**4a. Access Calculator**
1. Click on a dive
2. Scroll to **Profits** section
3. Click to expand

**4b. Enter Your Numbers**

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| Unit Cost | Manufacturer quote |
| Batch Size | Your planned order |
| Shipping/Unit | Freight quote ÷ units |
| Amazon Fees | Auto-calculated |
| Retail Price | Your selling price |

**4c. Review Output**
The calculator shows:
- Total COGS breakdown
- Profit per unit
- Required launch budget
- ROI percentage

### Step 5: Compare Budget Requirements
After entering profits data for multiple products:

1. Go back to Pipeline view
2. Sort or filter by budget required
3. Match opportunities to your available capital

**Budget Planning Example:**
```
Available: $50,000

Product A: $15,000 launch budget - 180% ROI
Product B: $25,000 launch budget - 150% ROI
Product C: $45,000 launch budget - 200% ROI

Decision: Launch A + B, save C for later
```

### Step 6: Review Summary Metrics
The pipeline provides aggregate views:

| Metric | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| Search Volume Summary | Higher = more demand |
| Competitor Strength | Lower = easier entry |
| Review Count Average | Lower = less established |
| Price Point Median | Match your target range |

### Step 7: Create Comparison Notes
For your top 3-5 candidates, document:

```
Product: [Name]
Score: [X]
Pros:
- [Strength 1]
- [Strength 2]
Cons:
- [Concern 1]
- [Concern 2]
Budget Required: $[X]
ROI Estimate: [X]%
Decision: [Go/Maybe/Pass]
```

### Step 8: Prioritize and Assign Next Steps
Create action items for moving forward:

**For "Go" Products:**
- [ ] Request manufacturer samples
- [ ] Get final quotes with MOQ
- [ ] Research shipping options
- [ ] Plan launch timeline

**For "Maybe" Products:**
- [ ] Get preliminary quotes
- [ ] Research further
- [ ] Revisit in 2 weeks

**For "Pass" Products:**
- [ ] Archive dive
- [ ] Note reason for passing
- [ ] May revisit if market changes

### Step 9: Set Up Tracking (Optional)
For products moving to launch:
1. Create Rank Radar (SOP-401)
2. Begin monitoring competitor keywords
3. Establish baseline before your launch

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All validated products labeled
- [ ] Top candidates have profit calculations
- [ ] Budget requirements documented
- [ ] Clear priority order established
- [ ] Next steps assigned for top products

## Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Scores inconsistent | Verify same scoring method used |
| Can't compare fairly | Ensure MKLs equally cleaned |
| Budget too high for all | Start with lowest-budget option |
| Too many candidates | Focus on top 5, archive rest |

## Pipeline Review Frequency

| Stage | Review Cadence |
|-------|----------------|
| Active research | Weekly |
| Getting quotes | Every 2-3 days |
| Ready to launch | Daily |
| Monitoring | Monthly |
