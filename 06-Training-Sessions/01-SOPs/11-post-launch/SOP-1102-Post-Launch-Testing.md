## Part 1: Understanding What to Test

### Testable Elements

| Element | Impact On | Test Priority |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Main Image** | CTR (Click-Through Rate) | HIGH |
| **Price** | Conversion + CTR | HIGH |
| **Title** | CTR + SEO | MEDIUM |
| **Bullet Points** | Conversion | MEDIUM |
| **Secondary Images** | Conversion | MEDIUM |
| **A+ Content** | Conversion | LOW |
| **Description** | Conversion (minimal) | LOW |

### Testing Priority Order

1. **Main Image** - Biggest impact on traffic
2. **Pricing** - Direct impact on conversions
3. **Title** - Affects both clicks and SEO
4. **Bullet Points** - Conversion optimization
5. **Supporting Images** - Extended engagement

---

## Part 2: Establishing Baselines

### Collect Baseline Metrics

Before testing, document current performance:

**Business Reports Data (14-day period):**

| Metric | Value | Date Range |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Sessions | | |
| Page Views | | |
| Units Ordered | | |
| Conversion Rate | | |
| Buy Box % | | |

**Advertising Data:**

| Metric | Value | Date Range |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Impressions | | |
| Clicks | | |
| CTR | | |
| ACOS | | |

**Finding Data:**
1. Go to **Reports** → **Business Reports** → **Detail Page Sales and Traffic**
2. Select your ASIN
3. Set date range (14 days recommended)
4. Export data

### Calculate Baseline Conversion Rate

```
Conversion Rate = Units Ordered / Sessions x 100

Example:
50 units / 500 sessions = 10% conversion rate
```

### Document Current Listing

Take screenshots of:
- [ ] Main image
- [ ] All secondary images
- [ ] Title
- [ ] Bullet points
- [ ] Price
- [ ] A+ Content (if applicable)

---

## Part 3: Image Testing

### Main Image A/B Testing

**Why Main Image Matters:**
- 80% of shoppers make click decisions based on main image
- Directly impacts CTR from search results
- Most significant single element

**Test Ideas:**

| Variation | What to Test |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Angle** | Front vs. 3/4 view vs. top-down |
| **Background** | Pure white vs. contextual elements |
| **Inclusions** | Product only vs. with accessories |
| **Scale** | Size reference vs. no reference |
| **Packaging** | With box vs. without box |

### Testing Methods

**Method 1: Amazon Manage Your Experiments (Brand Registered)**

1. Go to **Brands** → **Manage Your Experiments**
2. Select **A+ Content** or **Images** (if available)
3. Create experiment with two variants
4. Amazon automatically splits traffic
5. Run for 4-10 weeks

**Method 2: Manual Rotation**

1. Change main image
2. Run for 7-14 days
3. Document performance
4. Compare to baseline
5. Keep winner or test new variant

**Method 3: Pre-Test with External Tools**

| Tool | What It Does | Cost |
|------|--------------|------|
| PickFu | Poll real shoppers | $50-200/test |
| Intellivy | Amazon shopper focus groups | Varies |
| UsabilityHub | Click tests | $20-100/test |

## Part 4: Price Testing

### Understanding Price Elasticity

Different products respond differently to price changes:

| Price Sensitivity | Characteristics | Approach |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| **High** | Many alternatives, commoditized | Compete on price |
| **Medium** | Some differentiation | Test carefully |
| **Low** | Unique product, brand loyalty | Premium pricing ok |

### Price Test Structure

**Test 1: Price Increase**
| Metric | Baseline | +10% Price | Impact |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| Sessions | | | |
| Conversion Rate | | | |
| Units Sold | | | |
| Revenue | | | |
| Profit | | | |

**Test 2: Price Decrease**
| Metric | Baseline | -10% Price | Impact |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|
| Sessions | | | |
| Conversion Rate | | | |
| Units Sold | | | |
| Revenue | | | |
| Profit | | | |

### Price Testing Process

1. **Document current price and performance** (7 days)
2. **Increase price by 10%**
3. **Run for 7-14 days**
4. **Document results**
5. **Return to baseline or test lower price**
6. **Analyze profit impact, not just conversion**

### Price Calculation Example

```
SCENARIO: $29.99 baseline price

TEST: Increase to $32.99 (+10%)

Before:
- Price: $29.99
- Units/day: 10
- Revenue/day: $299.90
- Margin: 25% = $74.98 profit/day

After (same units):
- Price: $32.99
- Units/day: 10
- Revenue/day: $329.90
- Margin: 28% = $92.37 profit/day

After (10% fewer units):
- Price: $32.99
- Units/day: 9
- Revenue/day: $296.91
- Margin: 28% = $83.14 profit/day

RESULT: Even with 10% fewer sales, profit increased
```

## Part 5: Coupon Strategy Testing

### Types of Coupons

| Coupon Type | Best For | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Percentage Off** | Higher-priced items | 15% off |
| **Dollar Off** | Lower-priced items | $5 off |
| **Subscribe & Save** | Consumables | Extra 5% off |

### Testing Coupon Impact

**Test Variables:**
- Coupon vs. No Coupon
- 10% vs. 15% vs. 20% off
- Limited time vs. Ongoing

**Metrics to Track:**

| Metric | Without Coupon | With Coupon | Difference |
|--------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Sessions | | | |
| Conversion Rate | | | |
| Units Sold | | | |
| Revenue | | | |
| Coupon Cost | N/A | | |
| Net Profit | | | |

### Coupon Psychology

- **Green badge** in search results increases CTR
- **Urgency** if time-limited
- **Perceived value** increases even if small discount

## Part 6: Bullet Point and Title Testing

### Title Testing Strategy

**Elements to Test:**
| Element | Option A | Option B |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Keyword order | Primary keyword first | Brand first |
| Length | Short (80 chars) | Long (150 chars) |
| Features | Technical specs | Benefits |
| Format | Pipes/dashes | Natural language |

**Example:**
```
Version A (Keyword First):
"Type VI Hot Tub Filter Replacement - 6 Pack - Compatible with Bestway Saluspa"

Version B (Brand First):
"Bestway Saluspa Compatible Filter Cartridge - Type VI - 6 Pack Hot Tub Filters"
```

### Bullet Point Testing

**Test Focus Areas:**
1. **Order** - Most compelling benefit first
2. **Format** - Capitalize keywords vs. sentence case
3. **Length** - Short punchy vs. detailed
4. **Content** - Features vs. benefits

**Testing Process:**
1. Change ONE bullet at a time
2. Run for 14 days
3. Compare conversion rate
4. Keep winner, test next bullet
