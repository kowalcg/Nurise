# SOP-402: Weekly Monitoring Routine

**Nurise Listing Optimization**

---

## Purpose
Regularly monitor keyword positions, identify issues early, and find opportunities for optimization using Rank Radar's heat map and data views.

## When to Use
- 2-3 times per week (recommended)
- After listing changes (3-5 days later)
- When investigating performance drops
- To identify new campaign opportunities

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Rank Radar set up (SOP-401)
- [ ] At least 1 week of tracking data
- [ ] Access to DataDive

---

## Procedure

### Step 1: Open Rank Radar
1. Navigate to **Niche Pipeline**
2. Select your product's Dive
3. Open **Rank Radar**

### Step 2: Review the Heat Map
The heat map shows keyword positions over time:

**Reading the Colors:**
- **Green shades** = Better positions (closer to 1)
- **Red/Orange** = Worse positions (higher numbers)
- **Gray gaps** = No data for that period

**What to Look For:**
- [ ] Overall color trend (improving or declining?)
- [ ] Keywords slipping from green to red
- [ ] Position changes > 10 spots
- [ ] Keywords stuck at 101+

### Step 3: Check for Warning Signs

| Warning Sign | Action Needed |
|-------------|---------------|
| Keyword dropped 10+ spots | Investigate immediately |
| Position at 46+ | Getting pushed off page 1 |
| Stuck at 101+ | Check browse node/indexing |
| Gradual upward trend | Add campaign support |

### Step 4: Enable Roots View
Toggle on **Roots** to group keywords:

1. Click "Roots" toggle
2. Keywords group by root words
3. Review each root group:
   - Are all variations performing?
   - Any gaps in coverage?
   - Root groups stuck at high positions?

**Example:**
```
Root: "hot tub filter"
├── hot tub filter type vi  → Position 8 ✓
├── hot tub filter cartridge → Position 15 ✓
├── hot tub filter replacement → Position 67 ⚠
└── hot tub filters for spa → Position 101+ ✗
```

### Step 5: Check Impression Rank
Enable Impression Rank view:

| IR + Organic Combination | Interpretation |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| Low IR + Low Organic | Excellent - dominating |
| Low IR + High Organic | PPC working, organic lagging |
| High IR + Low Organic | Running out of budget |
| No IR + Good Organic | Needs campaign coverage |

### Step 6: Review PPC Data
Check campaign coverage:

1. Look for keywords with no campaign
2. Identify "Blind Spend" keywords
3. Note high-converting keywords needing more budget

**Opportunity Checklist:**
- [ ] Good organic rank + no campaign = Add exact match
- [ ] High CVR + low spend = Increase budget
- [ ] Root group gaps = Add to campaigns

### Step 7: Check SQP Performance
Review Search Query Performance data:

**Key Metrics:**
- Clicks on your listing
- Add to Cart rate
- Purchase conversion
- Your CVR vs market

**CTR Benchmarks:**
| CTR Range | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Below 0.3% | Needs work immediately |
| 0.3% - 0.4% | Baseline acceptable |
| 0.4% - 0.7% | Common range |
| Above 0.7% | Good |

### Step 8: Identify Opportunities
Look for these patterns:

**Opportunity 1: Organic Rank + No Campaign**
- Good position (top 45)
- No ad support
- Action: Create exact match campaign

**Opportunity 2: High CVR + Low Spend**
- 30-40%+ conversion rate
- Low ad spend
- Action: Increase budget

**Opportunity 3: Position Slipping**
- Was top 10, now dropping
- Still salvageable
- Action: Add PPC support before it's lost

### Step 9: Interpret Performance Patterns

**Excellent Performance:**
- All keywords holding steady
- Mostly top 10 positions
- Minimal fluctuation

**Normal (Launching/Optimizing):**
- Positions fluctuating
- Some improving, some testing
- Gradual downward trend = Good

**Bad Performance:**
- Stuck at 50+, 101+
- No improvement despite effort
- May need troubleshooting (SOP-501)

### Step 10: Document Findings
Log your monitoring session:
