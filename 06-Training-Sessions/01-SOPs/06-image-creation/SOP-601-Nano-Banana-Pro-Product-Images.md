## Part 6: Iterative Refinement

### The Power of Conversation

Nano Banana Pro allows you to **refine images through conversation**. This is its killer feature.

### Refinement Prompts

**Change Text:**
```
Change the text to say "[NEW TEXT]" instead
```

**Adjust Colors:**
```
Change the background color to [COLOR]
Make the lighting warmer/cooler
```

**Modify Composition:**
```
Move the product more to the left
Zoom in closer on the product
Add more space around the edges
```

**Fix Issues:**
```
The label text is slightly wrong - please regenerate with accurate text
Make the shadow more subtle
Remove the reflection on the right side
```

**Add Elements:**
```
Add a subtle steam effect rising from the spa
Include a hand reaching to install the filter
Add water droplets on the product
```

### Refinement Best Practices

1. **Be Specific** - "Make it bluer" is worse than "Change to navy blue (#1a365d)"
2. **One Change at a Time** - Don't ask for 5 changes at once
3. **Reference Previous** - "Keep everything else the same, but..."
4. **Save Good Versions** - Download images you like before further edits

## Part 9: Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Technique 1: Photography Terms

Add professional photography terms for better results:

```
Camera Settings:
- "85mm prime lens" - Portrait-style compression
- "f/2.8" - Shallow depth of field (blurred background)
- "f/8" - Sharp throughout (product shots)
- "ISO 100" - Clean, no grain

Lighting Terms:
- "Softbox lighting" - Even, professional
- "High-key lighting" - Bright, white background
- "Rim lighting" - Glowing edge effect
- "Natural window light" - Soft, authentic feel

Composition Terms:
- "Rule of thirds" - Off-center placement
- "Negative space" - Room around product
- "Hero shot" - Dramatic, prominent
```

### Technique 2: Reference Image Stacking

For complex products, "stack" reference images:

```
Upload these images:
1. [Product front photo]
2. [Product side photo]
3. [Product detail photo]
4. [Reference image showing desired style/mood]

Then prompt:
"Using the product in images 1-3, create an image in the style and
mood of image 4. Keep the product 100% accurate to the reference photos."
```

### Technique 3: Iterative Generation

Instead of one perfect prompt, use a conversation:

```
Prompt 1: "Create a professional product photo of this filter"
[Review result]

Prompt 2: "Good, but make the background pure white"
[Review result]

Prompt 3: "Perfect. Now add soft shadow underneath"
[Review result]

Prompt 4: "Make the shadow 50% more subtle"
[Final result]
```

## Part 10: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Distorted product | Not enough reference angles | Upload 5+ angles including all sides |
| Wrong text on label | AI interpretation | Upload close-up of label, explicitly describe text |
| Unrealistic proportions | Scale confusion | Include size reference in photo or describe dimensions |
| Inconsistent style | Different prompts | Use same style descriptors across all images |
| Low resolution | Default output | Request "high resolution, 4K, detailed" in prompt |
| Wrong colors | Lighting in reference | Shoot reference photos in neutral daylight |

### When to Use Photoshop/Canva Instead

- **Text replacement** - If AI keeps getting text wrong
- **Logo placement** - For brand-consistent logo application
- **Color matching** - Exact brand color requirements
- **Composite images** - Combining multiple AI outputs
