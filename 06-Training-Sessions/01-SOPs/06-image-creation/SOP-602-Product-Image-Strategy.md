## Part 1: Understanding Image Strategy

### The Shopper's Journey on Amazon

```
SHOPPER DECISION PROCESS
========================
1. SEARCH → Sees main image in results
   └── Decision: Click or scroll past? (CTR)

2. CLICK → Lands on product page
   └── Decision: Explore further or leave?

3. BROWSE → Views image gallery
   └── Decision: Continue reading or bounce?

4. EVALUATE → Reads bullets, reviews
   └── Decision: Add to cart or compare?

5. PURCHASE → Clicks Buy
   └── Goal achieved!
```

### Key Metrics Images Impact

| Metric | Which Images Impact |
|--------|---------------------|
| **CTR** (Click-Through Rate) | Main image (search results) |
| **Time on Page** | All gallery images |
| **Conversion Rate** | Entire image sequence |
| **Return Rate** | Accurate representation images |

---

## Part 2: The 7-Image Framework

### Image Sequence Strategy

Amazon allows 7+ images. Each should have a specific purpose:

| Position | Image Type | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **1** | Hero/Main | Stop the scroll, generate clicks |
| **2** | Journey Starter | Hook interest, show main benefit |
| **3** | Feature Showcase | Highlight key features (FAB) |
| **4** | Social Proof/Comparison | Build confidence |
| **5** | Use Case/Lifestyle | Show product in action |
| **6** | Technical Details | Answer common questions |
| **7** | Call to Action | Push toward purchase |

### Detailed Image Breakdown

**Strategy:**
