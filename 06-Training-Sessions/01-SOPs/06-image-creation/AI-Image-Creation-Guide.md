# AI Image Creation Guide for Amazon Listings

**Nurise Listing Optimization**

---

## Overview

This guide covers using ChatGPT 4o to create professional Amazon listing images, including main images, secondary images, and infographics. AI image generation can produce usable assets in minutes rather than hours.

### What You Can Create

| Image Type | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| Main Images | Product on white background, with parts, with packaging |
| Secondary Images | Sizing, durability, applications, POV shots |
| Infographics | Feature callouts, comparisons, benefits |
| Lifestyle Images | Product in use, scenarios |

### Time Comparison

| Method | Time |
|--------|------|
| Traditional design | Hours to days |
| AI generation | Minutes per image |
| AI with revisions | 5-15 minutes per final image |

## Part 1: Getting Started with ChatGPT 4o

### Basic Setup

1. Access ChatGPT with 4o model
2. Create a **Project** for your product
3. Organize tasks within the project

### Project Organization

Keep concepts separate to avoid confusion:

```
Project: [Product Name]
├── Main Image v1
├── Main Image v2
├── Durability Graphic
├── Ease of Use Graphic
├── POV/Magnification Graphic
└── Applications Graphic
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Long threads confuse the AI
- Multiple reference images cause blending
- Separate tasks = cleaner results

### Speed Tips

- Each image: 1-1.5 minutes to render
- Run multiple tasks simultaneously
- If stuck over 1.5 minutes, type "Why isn't this starting?"

---

## Part 2: Creating Main Images

### Main Image Levels

**Level 1: Product Only**
- Basic white background
- 3D render style
- Clean and professional

**Level 2: Product + Parts (Inclusions)**
```
Product + carrying case + accessories + extras
```

**Level 3: Product + Parts + Packaging**
```
Product + inclusions + branded box with keywords
```

### Main Image Prompt Example

```
Create a product photo on a pure white background showing:
- [Product description]
- Clean, professional lighting
- 3D render style

Scale: 2000 x 2500 pixels
```

### Scaling Images

Request specific dimensions:
- Standard: 2000 x 2500 pixels
- ChatGPT 4o can upscale automatically

---

## Part 3: Creating Secondary Images

### Common Secondary Image Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Sizing graphic | Show dimensions/fit |
| Durability graphic | Address drop/water concerns |
| Applications graphic | Show use cases |
| POV/Magnification | Show product in action |
| Product anatomy | Highlight features |
| Ease of use | Show simplicity |
| Gifting | Holiday/occasion themes |

### Applications Graphic Layout

Show multiple use cases in quadrants:

```
┌──────────┬──────────┐
│ Camping  │ Sports   │
├──────────┼──────────┤
│Road Trip │ Hiking   │
└──────────┴──────────┘
```

### Durability Graphic Elements

Common elements to include:
- Person interacting with product
- Drop or water scenario
- "Shockproof" / "Waterproof" text
- Action shot showing durability

---

## Part 4: The Sketch Method

### Why Sketch First

Drawing a simple layout helps you:
- Describe exactly what you want
- Verify all elements before refinement
- Get cartoonish V1 for approval
- Refine to photorealistic

### Sketch Process

**Step 1: Draw Layout**
Simple sketch showing:
- Where text goes
- Where images go
- General composition

**Step 2: Add Text Description**
Describe each element clearly:
- Title/subtitle text
- Scene descriptions
- Person actions
- Color preferences

**Step 3: Generate V1**
- First output will be cartoonish
- Verify all elements present
- Check layout is correct

**Step 4: Refine**
```
"Make this more photorealistic"
```

### Sketch Elements to Include

1. Title placement
2. Person position and action
3. Product placement
4. Background elements
5. Text labels

## Part 5: Handling People in Images

### The Context Rule

ChatGPT needs context to create people:

**Bad Prompt (Too Vague):**
```
"I want a photo of a girl using binoculars"
= May be rejected
```

**Good Prompt (With Context):**
```
"For extra context, this is a scene of a homeowner maintaining
their inflatable hot tub on a patio. They should be wearing
casual outdoor clothing. The adult should be in their 30s-40s
and look relaxed while performing routine maintenance."
= Accepted
```

### Context Elements to Include

1. **Setting/scenario** (backyard patio, spa maintenance, pool area)
2. **Activity being performed** (filter replacement, spa cleaning, relaxation)
3. **Appropriate clothing** (casual outdoor wear, swimwear if in spa)
4. **Age range** (7-9 years old, adult, etc.)
5. **Color scheme/mood** (outdoor, bright, natural)

## Part 6: Using Reference Images

### Types of Reference Images

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| Hand-drawn sketch | Layout planning |
| Competitor image | Style inspiration |
| Your product photo | Product accuracy |
| Design library examples | Infographic style |

### How to Use References

1. Upload reference image to ChatGPT
2. Describe what you like about it
3. Request similar style for your product
4. Iterate from there

## Part 7: Revision Best Practices

### Optimal Revision Count

**Sweet Spot: 5-7 revisions**

| Revisions | Quality |
|-----------|---------|
| 1-3 | Improving significantly |
| 4-5 | Fine-tuning |
| 6-7 | Marginal improvements |
| 8+ | Often getting worse |

### When to Stop

Signs to stop revising:
- Quality degrading
- New problems appearing
- Same issues repeating
- Thread getting confused

### Hybrid Approach

After 5-7 revisions:
1. Take best elements from different versions
2. Hand off to designer for final polish
3. Combine quadrants from different outputs
4. Fix minor issues in Photoshop

---

## Part 8: Market Research for Images

### Why Research First

Identify what graphics to create based on:
- Customer objections (DRAB analysis)
- Competitor gaps
- High-frequency concerns

### Key Questions

1. What are top customer objections?
2. How many competitors address them visually?
3. Are existing competitor graphics good?
4. Where are the gaps?

### Graphic Strategy

| Situation | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| No competitor graphics | Create to differentiate |
| Poor competitor graphics | Create better version |
| Good competitor graphics | Match or exceed quality |

---

## Part 9: Complete Workflow

### Phase 1: Research
1. Review customer feedback/objections
2. Audit competitor graphics
3. Identify gaps/opportunities
4. List graphic types needed

### Phase 2: Planning
1. Gather reference images
2. Sketch layouts
3. Write text descriptions
4. Prepare context for people shots

### Phase 3: Creation
1. Create ChatGPT project
2. Separate tasks for each graphic
3. Upload reference images
4. Generate V1 (cartoonish OK)
5. Verify all elements present
6. Request "more photorealistic"
7. Iterate 3-5 times max

### Phase 4: Refinement
1. Select best outputs
2. Hand off to designer if needed
3. Final polish in editing software
4. Combine best elements

### Phase 5: Testing
1. Run market research tests
2. Compare against current assets
3. Compare against competitors
4. Deploy winners
