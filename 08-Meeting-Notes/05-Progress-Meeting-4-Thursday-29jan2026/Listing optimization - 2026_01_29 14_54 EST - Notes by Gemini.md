### Summary

Greg Kowalczyk led a discussion on optimizing listings, focusing on Amazon’s AI search algorithms, Cosmo and Rufus, and applying optimization strategies to the high-performing spa filter SKU, suggesting multipacks to enhance value despite current competitive pricing challenges. Greg Kowalczyk, Todd McDaniel, and Douae Lahlou discussed leveraging AI tools like Claude code and Data Dive for keyword optimization, analyzing organic rankings, and implementing flat files to update listings and adhere to dual-language compliance for French keywords where searchable. Douae Lahlou will update an 18-item spreadsheet with fulfillment fees and insights for Todd McDaniel to review and then share with Greg Kowalczyk for economic analysis, while Todd McDaniel will validate costs and retail prices for new orders to secure a Purchase Order soon.

### Details

* **Optimization Strategy for Listings** Greg Kowalczyk proposed walking through optimization strategies for existing listings, focusing on factors like Amazon's Rufus and Cosmo algorithms, which influence search and ranking ([00:00:00](#00:00:00)). Todd McDaniel acknowledged the proposed strategy, emphasizing the intent to gain valuable learnings from the bouncy castle listing despite clearing out inventory and moving through remaining goods before their insurance renews on April 1 ([00:05:09](#00:05:09)). Greg Kowalczyk confirmed the importance of optimizing the spa filter listing due to its status as their best SKU and the opportunity to increase searchability and awareness through keyword and visual improvements.

* **Spa Filter Optimization and Multipacks** The spa filter SKU, their best performer, presents optimization opportunities, especially concerning competition with different pack sizes and the need to present the item as a value pack ([00:06:23](#00:06:23)). Greg Kowalczyk noted the current two-pack is being competitively beaten on price per unit, suggesting that although the listing is performing "not bad," they can significantly improve by reducing the price per unit. Todd McDaniel expressed interest in having Greg Kowalczyk explain this thinking.

* **Amazon's AI Search Algorithms (Cosmo and Rufus)** Greg Kowalczyk explained that Cosmo is Amazon's back-end AI algorithm interpreting and determining product relevancy, moving beyond simple keyword matching to analyze listing content, images, reviews, and shopping patterns. Rufus, the front-end conversational assistant, works with Cosmo to display products closely matching the user's search and profile ([00:09:06](#00:09:06)) ([00:12:35](#00:12:35)). Greg Kowalczyk confirmed that Cosmo is Amazon's proprietary software, emphasizing the impact this system has on listing creation, requiring specificity in content strategy, visual optimization, and backend data ([00:14:02](#00:14:02)).

* **Listing Content Strategy and Visual Optimization** Due to the AI search algorithms, listings must be specific on a conversational level, moving past generic terms like "garlic press" to detailed descriptions such as "stainless steel garlic press". Greg Kowalczyk stressed the importance of images, including their naming conventions (using keywords separated by dashes) ([00:15:43](#00:15:43)). Cosmo is capable of reading text within images, allowing it to match features and benefits displayed visually with customer searches through Rufus ([00:17:12](#00:17:12)).

* **Applying Cosmo Rules and Listing Analysis** Todd McDaniel asked if analysis from Cosmo was available in Seller Central to help optimize listings. Greg Kowalczyk clarified that one must learn and apply Cosmo's operating rules to the listing rather than getting direct information from Amazon about "Cosmo-related" issues. Douae Lahlou mentioned having already worked on some items and consolidated observations and insights in a sheet to upload for optimization, which they hoped to review later ([00:18:50](#00:18:50)). Greg Kowalczyk outlined SOPs for product validation and listing optimization, including listing analysis, keyword optimization, and image creation tips ([00:20:25](#00:20:25)).

* **Inclusion of French Keywords** Douae Lahlou inquired about the necessity of including French keywords in listings. Greg Kowalczyk stated that if French keywords are included in the Master Keyword List (MKL) with high searchability, they should be used in the front end. If searchability is still valuable, they should be placed in the bullet points, description, or the backend ([00:25:15](#00:25:15)). Todd McDaniel noted that Amazon.ca allows toggling between English and French, suggesting automatic translation, but Greg Kowalczyk shared that Amazon is increasingly enforcing dual-language compliance, including on packaging and sometimes requiring translation of images ([00:26:46](#00:26:46)).

* **Keyword Optimization Process** Greg Kowalczyk demonstrated the keyword optimization process using Data Dive, starting with cleaning the MKL for relevancy and comparing against competitors' top keywords ([00:29:38](#00:29:38)). The tool breaks down keywords into "roots" to identify the most searchable terms ([00:31:37](#00:31:37)). Douae Lahlou sought clarification on using roots, and Greg Kowalczyk explained the goal is to combine relevant roots to create long-tail keywords that are highly relevant to the specific product, such as "hot top filter" versus just "filter" ([00:33:22](#00:33:22)).

* **Ranking Analysis and Rank Radar** Using a magnifying glass view, Greg Kowalczyk showed how to identify strong competitors and organic keyword rankings (position number) ([00:36:10](#00:36:10)). They introduced Rank Radar as a tool for tracking each specific keyword's ranking over time ([00:39:21](#00:39:21)). For the hot tub filter, the current ranking for "hot tub filter" was at position 94, with the goal being to move all "red" rankings (poor performance) closer to one (green). Greg Kowalczyk confirmed that Rank Radar should be created for every available listing, but cautioned about keyword limits, suggesting focusing on 3 to 5 keywords at a time for aggressive pushing ([00:40:46](#00:40:46)) ([00:43:01](#00:43:01)).

* **Building Product Knowledge and Listing Builder** Greg Kowalczyk explained the process of building a knowledge base for the product using an AI Product Brief tool, which functions like a sophisticated Chat GPT, leveraging data from competitors' listings to identify features, benefits, and customer feedback ([00:47:25](#00:47:25)). The tool analyzes competitor listings for attributes like compatibility, maintenance, and durability ([00:50:36](#00:50:36)). Douae Lahlou noted they could not see the product brief Greg Kowalczyk had done, and Greg Kowalczyk confirmed the product brief must be copied and pasted, and they would check sharing rights later ([00:55:23](#00:55:23)). The Listing Builder aggregates data to show the "ranking juice" (search volume based on keywords) and predicted improvements after modification ([00:57:43](#00:57:43)). By improving SEO for the spa filter, the listing’s searchability score could potentially increase from 7,100 to 23,000 ([00:59:19](#00:59:19)).

* **Listing Optimization and A+ Content** Greg Kowalczyk explained that the current focus is on optimizing the listing's front end, specifically the product description and bullet points, noting that A+ content is not being prioritized as not all sellers have access to it. Greg Kowalczyk emphasized the need to optimize the title and bullet points for keywords, striving for 250 characters per bullet point to maximize ranking juice ([01:01:14](#01:01:14)). They noted that exact keyword matches hold the most value (80-100% of the value score), compared to broad searches (40% of the value score) ([01:03:03](#01:03:03)).

* **AI Tool for Listing Optimization** Greg Kowalczyk outlined a strategy that starts with using an AI copywriter, such as the AI listing builder offering Cosmo and Rufus options, as a good starting point for optimization ([01:05:14](#01:05:14)). They mentioned running a test using the "data dive classic" first, then running "Cosmo Rufus" to compare and adjust, explaining that this maximizes product ranking juice by identifying keyword combinations and competitive strategies ([01:06:56](#01:06:56)). The AI tool formats the title according to the latest terms of service and gives options for optimization ([01:10:39](#01:10:39)).

* **Optimizing and Testing Listing Changes** Greg Kowalczyk demonstrated that the AI-generated suggestions for bullet points provide superior filtration and clear water descriptions compared to existing vague points, making them more customer and phrase-focused ([01:10:39](#01:10:39)). They advised against changing too many things at once, suggesting testing one change at a time after the initial full listing optimization. Experiments like listing updates may take one to two weeks to show observable results, while PPC ranking changes can be seen within 24 hours ([01:12:19](#01:12:19)).

* **Impact of Optimization on Ranking Juice** Greg Kowalczyk highlighted a significant increase in the listing's "ranking juice" after optimization, moving from 7,000 to 24,000, which surpasses the best competitor's 12,000 ([01:13:30](#01:13:30)). This is achieved by building keywords into the listing in a way that is rules-compliant and Cosmo-compliant ([01:14:56](#01:14:56)). They also discussed using the rank radar and a keywords overview table to monitor the effect of changes on individual keywords ([01:16:08](#01:16:08)).

* **Handling Listing Updates in Seller Central** Todd McDaniel inquired about the process of uploading listing improvements, and Greg Kowalczyk confirmed that sellers must either manually copy and paste changes or generate a flat file for upload into Seller Central ([01:19:00](#01:19:00)). Greg Kowalczyk recommended using flat files for updates as they are quicker, especially for multiple listings, and help maintain the latest format, preventing corruption or data loss ([01:20:15](#01:20:15)). Todd McDaniel shared their previous difficulties with updates taking effect and the need to open a ticket to have a representative make the changes ([01:23:09](#01:23:09)).

* **Addressing Listing Content and Keyword Violations** Greg Kowalczyk noted the importance of correcting technical aspects like keywords with slashes and no spaces, recommending the use of vertical lines or dashes with spaces as per the correct format ([01:25:41](#01:25:41)). Todd McDaniel pointed out that the competitor-related keywords "Arctic Spa" and "Beach Comr" should be excluded from the listing as they are brands that are not compatible, which Greg Kowalczyk accepted as valid for exclusion ([01:17:42](#01:17:42)) ([01:48:01](#01:48:01)). Greg Kowalczyk advised Todd McDaniel, as a brand owner, to police their brand (Saluspa) by reporting any competitors using their brand name in their keywords to Brand Registry to enforce removal, suggesting concise, TOS-aligned messages for reporting ([01:41:23](#01:41:23)).

* **Customer Engagement and Ranking Factors** Greg Kowalczyk stated that while listing content is crucial for the machine (Amazon's algorithm), images are often more important for customers, especially on mobile, which accounts for 70% of searches ([01:28:11](#01:28:11)). They explained that Amazon records the full customer journey, from search to finding the item, clicking, and ultimately buying, assigning "ranking juice" at each step ([01:29:41](#01:29:41)). Add-to-cart actions are also counted, indicating a comparative shopping behavior before a final decision ([01:33:18](#01:33:18)).

* **Price and Value Analysis** Greg Kowalczyk reviewed the product economics, highlighting that the current two-pack filter price results in a high per-filter cost for the customer compared to competitors offering multi-packs, making the value proposition weak ([01:36:22](#01:36:22)). They emphasized that on Amazon, winning on value is key, not necessarily being the cheapest ([01:38:06](#01:38:06)). Analyzing keyword performance showed the product ranking highly for low-volume search terms (e.g., rank 4 for 660 searches) but poorly for high-volume ones (e.g., rank 74 for 3,000 searches for "hot top filter"), indicating a loss of potential sales ([01:39:45](#01:39:45)).

* **Reimbursement and Brand Policing** Greg Kowalczyk stressed the importance of policing issues like lost inventory and overcharges by Amazon, recommending the use of templates (some available through tools like SellerSlice) to automatically recoup lost money, especially since the reporting window is only 90 days ([01:45:28](#01:45:28)). They reiterated that brand owners must actively police their listings against brand name misuse by competitors ([01:42:46](#01:42:46)) ([01:48:01](#01:48:01)).

* **Further Optimization Tools and Organic/Sponsored Ranking** Greg Kowalczyk mentioned using custom GPTs or tools like Claude for more advanced listing analysis and optimization beyond the initial good starting point ([01:50:27](#01:50:27)). They confirmed that advertising campaigns should target the same top keywords identified for organic search. Finally, they highlighted the importance of securing the top ranking spots, as the first few results typically capture 80% of sales ([01:54:20](#01:54:20)), and discussed the visual impact of images for differentiation in sponsored and organic rankings ([01:56:06](#01:56:06)).

* **Inventory Management and Shipping Logistics in Canada** Greg Kowalczyk emphasized the importance of maintaining an optimized inventory level, suggesting that sellers should "spoon feed the system as they want" based on customer demand signals. Todd McDaniel noted that recommended order sizes can seem large, prompting them to ship partial quantities and reassess later ([01:59:25](#01:59:25)). Greg Kowalczyk confirmed that in Canada, Amazon covers the costs for transfers between fulfillment centers, unlike the US where sellers pay an additional fee unless shipping five or more cartons ([02:00:47](#02:00:47)). Todd McDaniel observed that playing with shipment quantities sometimes changes the required fulfillment center, suggesting a reliance on trial and error to influence shipping location due to Amazon's algorithm ([02:02:07](#02:02:07)).

* **Circumventing Amazon's Fulfillment Center Algorithm** Greg Kowalczyk discussed how Amazon is closing loopholes related to pushing inventory to specific fulfillment centers, mentioning that previous third-party software for this purpose is no longer viable or is considered too risky to use ([02:02:07](#02:02:07)). They described a gray area tactic used by some sellers to influence the fulfillment center by creating a temporary "fake order," such as a removal or customer order, placing it on hold, creating a new shipment that targets the desired center, and then canceling the fake order once the inventory arrives ([02:03:27](#02:03:27)). They also noted that sometimes it is easier to create two separate shipments rather than one combined shipment to get two different fulfillment centers ([02:04:51](#02:04:51)).

* **Listing Optimization and Keyword Strategy** Greg Kowalczyk provided a listing optimization evaluation based on data from Data Dive and a deeper analysis using Claude code, which connects to external resources via MCPS and Perplexity ([02:04:51](#02:04:51)). They identified issues, such as vague benefits in bullet points, and noted a potential issue where French keywords are mixed into English bullets, suggesting these should be backend-only. Todd McDaniel confirmed that Greg Kowalczyk is utilizing Claude code, specifically the latest Opus 4.5 model, which uses Perplexity to search for keywords Data Dive may miss ([02:06:33](#02:06:33)).

* **Multipack Strategy for Increased Value and Profit** Greg Kowalczyk presented a multipack strategy, explaining that offering more options, such as 4-pack, 8-pack, and 12-pack bundles, increases customer value and can lead to higher revenue and larger profits ([02:08:29](#02:08:29)). They found that some products might be losing money due to PPC costs and suggested that multipacks can increase value, positioning the item as "premium quality" ([02:10:12](#02:10:12)). Todd McDaniel confirmed that new pack sizes, such as a 12-pack, could be added as a size or variation to an existing listing without losing ratings and reviews ([02:11:58](#02:11:58)).

* **Virtual Variations and Fulfillment Options** Greg Kowalczyk explained that Amazon is introducing "virtual variations," which allows bundling items without physically kitting them ([02:11:58](#02:11:58)). They noted that a manual virtual listing would result in FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant) because the item is not done by Amazon, which is less desirable for customers due to potential shipping fees and poorer economics for the seller ([02:13:09](#02:13:09)). Douae Lahlou and Todd McDaniel clarified that for a virtual 12-pack, Amazon would pick 6 units from a master pack of 24 and ship them as the 12-pack ([02:14:43](#02:14:43)). Greg Kowalczyk advised that for testing multipacks, if a party like Triumph can create kits, they could ship them to Amazon with only an FNSQ label inside an opaque bag to block the UPC code ([02:16:04](#02:16:04)).

* **Marketing and Pricing Strategy for Multipacks** Greg Kowalczyk emphasized that multipacks, such as 4-pack, 8-pack, and 12-pack, provide a better value for the customer, with a 12-pack offering up to a full year's supply. They mentioned that higher margins on larger packs allow room for couponing ([02:17:57](#02:17:57)). Furthermore, A+ content should be tailored to the specific variation; for example, a 12-pack might be marketed toward business customers with adjusted business pricing and advertised off-Amazon to stores. Todd McDaniel suggested that a 24-unit case pack would also appeal to business customers ([02:21:35](#02:21:35)).

* **Using Claude Code for Optimization** Douae Lahlou asked if they should also use Claude code to help with optimization for other listings. Greg Kowalczyk confirmed the tool is powerful but noted it has a steep learning curve since it is CLI (Command-Line Interface) based ([02:22:55](#02:22:55)). They also mentioned that Claude code is highly effective for AI-driven analysis, surpassing their use of tools like Chat GPT, and noted that they are starting to compete with players like Google, Chinese models, and Perplexity ([02:24:49](#02:24:49)).

* **Next Steps for Listing Updates and New Orders** Douae Lahlou requested clarification on the next steps for listing optimization ([02:26:42](#02:26:42)). Greg Kowalczyk stated that they need to update the listing with the latest title and bullet points derived from the Claude code report, which can then be applied to other listings like the jumping castle ([02:27:57](#02:27:57)). Todd McDaniel reported they need to validate costs and retail prices for new orders, as updated LCL pricing suggests increasing quantities to meet 20-foot container needs would be more sensible, with the goal to secure the Purchase Order (PO) soon ([02:29:14](#02:29:14)).

* **Action Items for Douae Lahlou's Item Analysis** Douae Lahlou reported having analyzed 18 distinct items and can send the spreadsheet of items to Greg Kowalczyk for further analysis ([02:29:14](#02:29:14)). Greg Kowalczyk requested that Douae Lahlou fill out the spreadsheet with as much information as possible, including notes on B2B opportunities ([02:30:20](#02:30:20)). Greg Kowalczyk specifically requested adding Amazon fulfillment fees and landed costs to the spreadsheet to allow them to quickly analyze the economics of the items using the analyzer tool ([02:31:25](#02:31:25)). Todd McDaniel and Douae Lahlou agreed that Douae Lahlou would update the spreadsheet with fulfillment fees and any other insights, and then send it to Todd McDaniel to add commentary before passing it to Greg Kowalczyk ([02:34:27](#02:34:27)).

### 00:00:00 {#00:00:00}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Hey,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Hey,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Greg.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Dad.  
**Todd McDaniel:** How's it going?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Good, thanks. How are you?  
**Todd McDaniel:** Good.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Just give me a sec. I don't know if Da got that uh link. Oh, yeah. She's here.  
**Todd McDaniel:** There she is. How you doing?  
**Douae Lahlou:** Hi guys, how are  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Hello.  
**Todd McDaniel:** All  
**Douae Lahlou:** you?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So I think uh yeah for today I'm not really sure you know how much uh you guys would like to cover but my my thinking was just basically to walk you through uh some of the optimization for the existing listings and what's the what's behind what's the idea you know what what is the uh the Amazon's uh you know the uh uh the new Rufus and Cosmo uh you know that that actually influence how we are actually optimizing for for the listings and how people are searching and uh and now how we have to actually uh change the listing in many different aspects to uh in order to uh to get this rank And uh and also you know for the two listings that you currently have uh what would make sense to to update and what's required and what are the blockages that might be uh uh there preventing you to update uh you know those  
   
 

### 00:05:09 {#00:05:09}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** listings.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah, on on the on the bouncy castle, I think DA mentioned and and I also mentioned like we're we're we're clearing out of it. Um, we had three listings and this was the lowest price point of the three bouncing castles that we had.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** And um we're we're almost out of the inventory, but I thought it would still be a good exercise for you know to get your eyes on what uh listing optimization would would look like for that so that we can you know still take the learnings from it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Right.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Uh we've al obviously lost money on it so I'd at least get like to get some learnings from it. Um, so and you know we still have some goods to to move through and if there's and you know we're trying to to move through them before April 1 when our uh insurance renews so we can say we're not in that category anymore. And if we can do that, you know,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** All  
**Todd McDaniel:** ensure that we we've sold through um and if we can do it, you know, minimizing any loss, uh as much as possible,  
   
 

### 00:06:23 {#00:06:23}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** right.  
**Todd McDaniel:** that uh that would be great. So, yeah, I'm happy to it might it might seem like it doesn't make sense to to spend too much time on it, but I think the learnings are are still going to be valuable uh on that one.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Hi.  
**Douae Lahlou:** What?  
**Todd McDaniel:** And then the the spa filter. Um well, it's our it's our best skew so far. I think we're we're not uh losing money on it yet, but there is. Um I know we talked about some of the competition with different pack sizes and that sort of thing is um is a is a factor. there is um Amazon had taken over that skew but we don't think that that's the case any longer. that shouldn't be a risk going going forward. And there is a lot of demand uh for that filter. And currently we're the only branded um exact replacement part out there in the market other than it's sold, you know, in store at a couple of bricks and mortar retailers.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:07:38

   
**Todd McDaniel:** So, I I think it makes sense for us, unless your findings tell us otherwise, to continue replenishing that skew with our upcoming  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Mhm. Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** order.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** The you know as far as I'm concerned I think this skill is uh you know definitely requires uh optimization and we have to just look from the perspective of uh the ownership as well. So we have to see uh right now I will show you uh the things that I found and you know what you can optimize in order to bump up the uh searchability and you know the awareness. So first of all the on the keyword basis then on a visual aspect. So basically for conversion and uh and  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh yeah so that's that's kind of a look look pretty interesting and there's a there is a huge opportunity I think with the multipacks because we have to look at uh at the uh at the item uh not really from the price point also price point is a big uh contributor, but you have to uh present the item as a as a value pack as well.  
   
 

### 00:09:06 {#00:09:06}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Right now, it's a two pack, but I think the competition is basically beating you on a un uh price per unit. So,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you know, I I think at this moment, you know, this this listing is is doing not bad. it can do much better. Uh but we have to kind of lower the price per unit.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It' be great if you could walk us through your thinking.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** And then just on the on the Rufus,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** um I don't know I don't know much about it, but it's basically uh like an AI enhancement on Amazon for  
**Douae Lahlou:** What the heck?  
**Todd McDaniel:** consumers.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** It's actually for both that's why I mentioned Cosmo and Rufus.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yep.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So Cosmo is basically the positioning uh of it is the back end search engine and Rufus is a front end uh like a conversational assistant for uh for the uh user. So the co cosmo if we look at the overall aspect of it.  
   
 

### 00:10:22

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So it's basically it's like a back end AI algorithm that is using the uh the model to interpret and determine product relevancy. So uh so for it's not uh driven by simply matching keywords. It's right now it's uh matching uh and analyzing the listing content, images, reviews, shopping patterns. uh then it generates the common sense kind of a knowledge graphs and maps the relationship between what's what the user is looking for and what you have offer. So it's a it's a really complicated they have a uh for this system  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** they have uh a very comprehensive uh uh trademark and not trademark but uh basically the uh what is called not trademark u the  
**Todd McDaniel:** Like the IP.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** patent yeah the IP for this and uh I was  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** actually studying the uh uh the document mentation what they they've done I think the document is around 100 pages and exactly explains you know how this searchability works and it's unbelievable how you know what's the engine behind it and how this is everything is connected right now through the AI and uh what's on a page and together with Rufus because Rufus is a conversational model that it actually uh allows the user to let's say search for something and then Amazon based on Cosmo it will be displaying there what they what they as close as  
   
 

### 00:12:35 {#00:12:35}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** possible what the customer is looking for and also because they have a very comprehensive data on each of the customers what they are looking for, what they are searching, they are actually uh teaching the model of you know every single time you're looking for something is basically teaching your profile your profile is becomes a kind of a learning uh agent for for Rufus to pick up and you know give  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you closer and closer uh uh um much that we are looking for and patterns you know let's say you are looking for toilet paper but the next time you're looking for a diapers and then for suckers so then it gets the relationship okay you must to have children then it gives you some additional uh you know products and all that stuff.  
**Todd McDaniel:** right?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So the same would be if someone is looking for a filter for a spa for whirlpool or for you know a pool then it will recommend you know later on a very relevant products you know for this specific family of the  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
   
 

### 00:14:02 {#00:14:02}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** products.  
**Todd McDaniel:** And is is Cosmo a tool that's embedded in Amazon today or isn't is not a third  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. Yeah. No,  
**Todd McDaniel:** party.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** no. It's a it's their own proprietary uh software and you know just basically like like the whole search engine they call it A9 now is I think a A1 it's a very sophisticated thing nobody knows who is working there and you know if you are you're not supposed to be sharing secrets or you know stuff like that so it's a very secret secretive uh you kind of a joint.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right, right, right. Area  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** 51\.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So even even right now with with this uh yeah it just gives uh even for us for the sellers it it has a very big impact on uh let's say the uh how how we have to uh look at the uh at the uh listing that we are creating. So it's just basically everything has to you know from from the content perspective content strategy to visual optimization backend data you know for a complete uh back end attributes and everything that uh overlays with text.  
   
 

### 00:15:43 {#00:15:43}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** We have to be really really specific and uh and not only keyword specific but you know conversational level specific. So we cannot really say any longer you know like a garlic press. You have to be specific what kind of garlic press you know stainless steel garlic press and you know or red or you know specific to the function of what it's doing. The same with the images. So images even with the naming convention. So every image that is being uploaded it has to be with the keyword. So let's say you're putting a image with garlic- press red- stain steel and specifically for that because that's SEO  
**Douae Lahlou:** Gotcha.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** compliant not underscore it has to be a dash the same with the what's behind because Cosmo is actually looking for the  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** text that not that it's not only written on a like a a fields in a back end or front front end but also uh inclusive in a uh in a visual content. So that includes the im images.  
   
 

### 00:17:12 {#00:17:12}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So it will read the images that you have. So let's say if your image shows features and benefits and customer is looking through rufus or you know through uh engagement with the platform what is the what they are looking for. So, Rufus and Cosmo, it will pick up that search and it will match with uh not only the keyword but with the full phrase and with all the benefits and everything. If you don't have anything uh on your listing uh or if you only have in few places even if you have on your image let's say bubbles and you know specifying feature and benefit it will pick it up if it's if it's done properly.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay. Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So so the customer engagement it's it's really really important.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Uh so that's why it's just even the listing creation like before uh a lot of places it was not really required that uh that we filled uh all the empty spaces but right now everything what's in the back back end it should be filled otherwise you know either somebody else will fill for you or it will be just you know uh ignore Ignore it and the Cosmo will be not able to find it.  
   
 

### 00:18:50 {#00:18:50}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Got it. So, so Cosmo, you can you can get some analysis from Cosmo on your listing compared to what  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** customers are looking for to help optimize. Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah,  
**Todd McDaniel:** And that's is that that resides in seller central.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** it's you know so ba basically uh uh you you you cannot you cannot get like a you know information uh Amazon will not tell you okay this is Cosmo related. You have to just learn the rules how Cosmo is actually operating and uh apply your uh your uh listing and apply everything what you are uh displaying to satisfy the Cosmo rules. So we have to just kind of learn what Cosmo is looking for and then you know give it to it.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Got it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So let me just put this on a on a screen and uh and I will  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** put uh this into the dashboard. So I will I will show you what I what I have so far.  
**Douae Lahlou:** So, I know today like it's about the update of the our two listings, but I started diving into the tool and exploring it a little bit and I worked on a few items.  
   
 

### 00:20:25 {#00:20:25}

   
**Douae Lahlou:** So I made the progress on the sheet. I was hoping I can show you at the end if we still have some time and then send it to you  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yep. Yes.  
**Douae Lahlou:** later if you can check my logic and tell me. So what I did basically is consolidate everything into uh the sheet like all my  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yep.  
**Douae Lahlou:** observations and insights so that when you can show us how to work with clothes code I can just upload it with as much information as possible.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Do are you talking about the the spreadsheet with the cost?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah, if we have some time at the end.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay. So, uh so first what I what I did so like right now I filled some uh uh sections in here. So the for the product analysis uh I think uh was working today there's few few more documents in here for the for the new analysis but uh uh basically I I prepare some SOPs in for for each uh section you know basically what what you what you uh actually have to do so let's say based on you know data dive and you have some additional information about data dive which I showed you before.  
   
 

### 00:21:54

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So, so there is a section for data dive resources, the main documentation advance,  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** some YouTube channels which directly shows you step by step of uh many things what uh what you have to do. But what we have in here is just kind of divided into uh uh what we are doing. So first of all the product validation. So the steps that we are taking to validate you know certain products uh so by com compiling the data. So let's say first we we have to do the research uh then uh the spreadsheet then we can uh uh validate each item uh and then get get the results and then uh you know once we have the selected items uh then we let's say putting them into uh into the uh Amazon environment. ment. So by uh listing creation and there is a uh so this with this one is the listing optimization. So when we have either a new listing completely new or an existing listing that we want to improve. So there are some you know listing analysis, keyword optimization, listing updates, uh listing builder, then we have Amazon indexing and some more references for indexing which is really important for for the keywords.  
   
 

### 00:23:35

   
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Then we have keyword tracking. We have some uh troubleshooting for uh uh diagn uh diagnostic uh things for the listings. Uh then also I give you some hints and tips what to do you know with the image creation like right now there are many options you know hiring a a a designer do it do it with your own uh capacity let's say using AI and then have maybe a designer just to to do the last 20 or 10% just to make some touch-ups and stuff like this. Uh then we have some more of a product analysis which we I think I showed you this with the uh the analyzer that I I completed. Then we have sections let's say for pre-launch. So uh keywords uh how we have to compile a listing uh package requirements and all that stuff. Then we have launch. Uh then we have some processes for uh PPC and then post launch how we we have to do uh certain things.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay, talking about keywords and everything, like I sometimes see French keywords in some listings,  
   
 

### 00:25:15 {#00:25:15}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** does everyone includes them? Like is there a need to do them in every lesson or just like when I see that they are included in the  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Uh yeah,  
**Douae Lahlou:** MKL?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** when they are included in MKL definitely and many times dep depends because uh you know for us uh in Canada French is you know the Quebec is what 5 million uh people. So it is significant but it's not as significant let's say like in US uh Spanish. So Spanish in US is probably about 80 90 million people uh you know versus 340 350 uh overall. So it's a much larger uh chunk of people that are you know their first language is Spanish. So for us French definitely if if there is a good keyword uh and if there is a huge searchability we put them in in the front end. If there is a still valuable searchability we always put them somewhere in a listing either it's on a bullet point or a description which has still some value but then we definitely put them in the back end.  
   
 

### 00:26:46 {#00:26:46}

   
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay. So, just when it's there and it's ranking,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes.  
**Douae Lahlou:** we can use them.  
**Todd McDaniel:** I I should know this,  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** but is there um a French uh uh user site for Amazon or or French-speaking customers using something to translate or is it is it English Customerf facing  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I'm I'm not No, I'm not I'm not I'm not really sure. They you know they you know that the packaging you  
**Todd McDaniel:** site.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** know uh in Canada should be dual language. Amazon was not really too too forceful to uh enforce this dual language until now. Now I hear more and more cases that you know that the sellers are being you know they're listing if they are not uh not only listing but uh their packaging that they are not uh they they not comply with dual language. So now the uh Amazon is kind of uh enforcing more that uh you know the French is also included on on each uh uh not only images but also physical product has uh basically either a label or you know the proper uh dual language uh translation.  
   
 

### 00:28:22

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay, I just answered my own question. I see there's a you can toggle on Amazon.ca between English and French site and it must just be automatically translated because I don't think we've ever submitted any French features and benefits for our listings.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** But some some items and I know from uh our uh let's say  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** held uh you know let's say for our tape we had to actually we have some translation on our packaging but uh it was not enough. So actually Amazon asked us to uh to uh include uh let's say the seventh and uh uh you know the last two images with full translation of each uh packaging. So you always are you always have an option you know because there's a  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** eight or nine uh spots for the images you can basically uh get the last two images and you know basically create uh dual language just just uh you know even uh with the Photoshop or somebody or even right now with the AI you can you can do a dual language  
   
 

### 00:29:38 {#00:29:38}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** All right. Right. Right.  
**Douae Lahlou:** We can do that.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** if it's require higher but now I think it will be uh you know more  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** enforceful okay  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** so so let's uh let's look at uh you know the data dive so when we when I have a data dive uh here so let's say uh for our niche pipeline so we have Uh so this is this is the filter. So I already done. So there are two uh two things uh actually you know first first you have to go to the uh master keyword list so the MKL and you know clean up as much as possible uh for your uh keywords relevancy and see uh you know with your uh with your listing uh and comparing with the the best let's say competitors what they are run and what they are uh running uh you know what their best keywords are uh where are uh you know so let's say if we filter this based on the search volume and we go from the top uh we can see let's say the uh the main keywords uh and you can actually see this with the with the roots uh you know what roots are mostly used for uh for searches, what people are actually uh searching the most.  
   
 

### 00:31:37 {#00:31:37}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** And uh so each uh word in this section is broken down into uh single single uh roots or and then combining them into uh uh uh multiple words keywords as well to see what is the search volume for each individual one. So right now you can see even based on the colors uh you know what are the most searchable keywords. So these are the keywords that you will have to uh uh start to uh rank and get the most sales. And you know this section is just the uh yeah gives you a a combination of the longtail keywords. So here this section just gives you the individual roots and allows you to filter and you know uh adjust them uh or when you are looking uh at certain uh uh certain keyword base. And uh so this is just uh allows you to uh identify the uh the easiest possible uh easiest keywords that to rank. So so once we have this then we go and then normalize and uh we just create for let's say PPC.  
   
 

### 00:33:22 {#00:33:22}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So once we have the all the roots uh there we can actually move them to a normalizer and the normalizer is just takes all the keywords drop uh of the plurals and uh uh and then uh gives you in the normalized form. But  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh  
**Douae Lahlou:** Um just not sure I understand how we have to use roots cuz I only see like it shows the main words that keeps repeating across keywords.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** M yeah you have the frequency but  
**Douae Lahlou:** But is it just to see like the frequency maybe? I don't  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you also have let's say if you have here so let's say hot  
**Douae Lahlou:** know.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** top but let's say hot top for the filter it's not really a keyword that you know a person it's looking for the uh filter based on the hot top uh keyword but the  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh if you look at here hot top filter already has 2,000 searches. So basically this uh the root is filter. It's a one uh one one word but it's not relevant for your your specific filter.  
   
 

### 00:34:44

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So it the relevancy for hot top filter it's much higher than you know one word.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So that's why we have to com combine as many clo uh  
**Douae Lahlou:** it's clearer.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** relevant roots as possible and then you know based on those roots you know so that's why you know this one it was selected uh pool filter then uh uh saluspa hot top filter because you have you know many searches in here and then we took best way. Most of the time you you this is being selected automatically. You just if you see any other ones that might be hiding,  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you just basically go and select and it will actually uh reformat uh and see if there is any combination of this specific root uh with that keyword. So, this is just a like a more like a work work in progress uh sheet that allows you to filter specific uh roots in order to compile uh longtail keywords.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Right. Got it. Thank  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay. So, so for those uh keywords in here,  
   
 

### 00:36:10 {#00:36:10}

   
**Douae Lahlou:** you.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** what we have is just uh yeah, we're looking at this just from the like a magnifying glass perspective. So, we're looking at you know what are the uh people are actually uh ranking for. So, we see from from this uh view we have few very strong ones. There is a one which is uh this guy. Uh but with this type, I'm not really sure because this is probably a double uh filter, but uh uh yeah, I'm not really sure if this is the uh an equivalent of two filters the same as these ones.  
**Todd McDaniel:** No, that's going to be um so there there's spas and hot tubs which are smaller and heated and then  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** there's pools larger unheated for for swimming and so  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Mhm.  
**Todd McDaniel:** I think that that pool that pool pure number two is a pool filter and they're much larger and uh wouldn't be wouldn't be compatible with  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** our item.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Because yeah, this this one uh this one is just took because they have included in their title uh yeah not only hot topup filter but  
   
 

### 00:37:31

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay, it says hot tub filter here.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** also there's a uh I think it was included the uh the V6 or something like that or maybe not. Okay. But anyways, if we are looking, you know, as the hot tub filter, we can see, yeah, this one. Yes. But then we also have, for example, this one uh ranks the number three. That one ranks number 19\. That one ranks number uh 22\. So actually you know like uh and you know all the other keywords you know where relevancy with a high relevancy for this specific uh type of product uh let's say where you have here 70 to uh to 100 uh yeah if we look at this guy organically they rank almost on all keyword words uh on the very first uh five position of the page. So the the number represents the position of your search of this specific keyword. If you uh go and search on Amazon, you know which position that's going to be at. So this is sponsored but then you have the filters you know like right here uh this is also sponsored this is sponsored sponsored actually yours here but this this one is in here.  
   
 

### 00:39:21 {#00:39:21}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So that will be the num uh position number. So if you if you count from the top, so nothing nothing counts here. Nothing come counts here as organic because this is everything is sponsored. Uh then uh here it's basically two four five nothing here. This sponsored sponsor sponsored 6 7 8 uh 7\.  
**Douae Lahlou:** So This gives us an idea about if we're going with an item if we  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** can push it push marketing at first or just test.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. So th this will give you uh a uh you know like a generic idea when you  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** are researching the product. Then once you starting to sell let's say you selling this already uh for quite some time. So I I started uh a uh  
**Todd McDaniel:** Awesome.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** what is the rank radar for this. So you can actually see each specific keyword how it's ranking. So right now it gives you all the position for each keyword.  
   
 

### 00:40:46 {#00:40:46}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So so let's say for hot tub filter uh your listing is ranking at pos today uh now today is here uh Wednesday  
**Todd McDaniel:** Sorry. Sorry. Guess someone's at the door.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** sure. So it's ranking at position 94 which is you know with so  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** many searches and with all other competitors that are uh selling much more than than you uh you know this would be the idea to bring this number uh you know closer to one. So, you know, that would be the, you know,  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** all the red ones you want to bring this to uh uh to green.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So, you have Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** So, it's a heat map. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So,  
**Douae Lahlou:** And then and then when do you get to use like rank radar?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** it's  
**Douae Lahlou:** Should we create it for every list we have  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes.  
**Douae Lahlou:** available?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay. And  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You just uh you have to be careful uh of the number uh number of  
   
 

### 00:41:53

   
**Douae Lahlou:** then  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** keywords. Not all the keywords are required to uh to be uh uh checked. So this one was was uh yeah was done uh I'm not really sure how many keywords uh there is. Uh yeah for 4 44 key keywords alto together for this plan right now I think you have 1,000 keywords that you can actually use the  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh rank radar.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So every listing that you will be uh adding more keywords it will just uh use  
**Douae Lahlou:** So,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** this uh from the bank. And if you want to use more keywords uh then the plan is just going to increase.  
**Douae Lahlou:** okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you have to just just buy uh individual sections. So there is a alakart as well but uh you know keywords it's a pretty  
**Douae Lahlou:** Inhale.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** decent  
**Douae Lahlou:** It's enough. Thank you. Okay. And you told me last time that I can add keywords directly to it,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** but I could only see the option to add asins.  
   
 

### 00:43:01 {#00:43:01}

   
**Douae Lahlou:** So,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** I'm not sure how to do it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** That's  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** why  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So for for this one yes it's a very valuable uh table and we always have to look at this you know uh during the optimization and you know for uh for this uh reason is you just we we take all this data based on the search volumes and the positions and then we determine okay which keyword are are we uh trying to rank right now. So uh you don't want to run uh you know uh let's say uh push multiple keywords. I would say at at one time and for one as we go anywhere from uh you know let's say maximum three to five keywords and if you want to be aggressive then you go with more but it's a very uh it can become very expensive you know you have to either organically push  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah, I imagine.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** it uh from the external sources or through PPC.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay. Yeah,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So this one is only I set it up only for for the filter itself.  
   
 

### 00:44:18

   
**Douae Lahlou:** I got you.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh just to to see you know the progress how we are doing and to uh to give you a visual uh you know how the item is actually doing and right now even without uh uh because it has already some data uh the item it's been on the market for quite some time and it has sales people are searching you guys are selling you know like 200 units a month. So this is already the the flywheel is already in progress. So we see where where the uh uh sales are coming from, what keywords are we already ranking, but then we are also seeing gaps and where where we should pay attention and what what type of uh you know uh uh tactics we we can take to uh you know to push uh other keywords and you know to get uh the item to rank more. So this is the rank radar. But let's say for new uh uh for new items when you analyze the item for you know for the uh validation purposes this is not required.  
   
 

### 00:45:43

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You know there's no point of collecting the data daily data because you you you will not wait uh uh so much time.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So we are only looking at the keyword uh uh keyword analysis for the uh master keyword list. And then once once we are satisfied with uh you know these keywords then we we basically check you know if there are any outliers uh so up to uh you know like the MKL is going I think from 40 to 100 then or to 30 uh then uh outliers and then any other ones if there are any other like uh uh less than 20 relevancy. And if you can see here some fil uh keywords that are still bringing some value uh let's say and they are relevant. So let's say you're looking at the search volume and then you can actually you know so filter it's not really relevant for this specific one. We have to be more specific. what kind of filter? Cuz this can be a furnace filter.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** And if that would be a relevant keyword, you would just mark this up and then selected keyword uh to include this into MKL and it would just move to uh your MKL.  
   
 

### 00:47:25 {#00:47:25}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So once we once we have this uh so for for analysis of uh let's say uh when I when I do this using you know AI using clot code or uh so then I export all my my research as a CSV file and it will give me two uh files. it will give me uh uh competitors it will give me also uh keywords. So competitors data it will give me all this here and then keywords data it will give me all this stuff and then I will combine this together with uh the findings that you had in a in a main uh Excel sheet. So, and it will pick up each individual item and compare this to our uh analysis uh requirements and then gives us you know do the all the calculations and everything and then gives us the the results. But for uh for this uh listing creation reason we we use couple of things. So right now we are starting to build uh a knowledge base about this item. So it has uh like in here the AI product brief.  
   
 

### 00:49:00

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So it's it's kind of a uh builtin let's say chat GPT. I I wouldn't say uh much more sophisticated. It's uh it's not primitive but it it has uh some uh let's say automation built in but also has some logic based on a data that uh data dive is providing us. uh so it's a little bit more than you would give this data to chat GPT you wouldn't be able to find many items because right now we are just uh we're just getting all the information from uh what Amazon gave us uh about all the competitors and right now we are trying to build a knowledge base about a product so so in first step. I already built this uh through. So if you have more competitors, you can only I think at this point you can select uh up to uh 20\. So you just basically click click click select which ones you you want to analyze uh the competitors. The next step it will be just it will uh uh go through uh the attributes included in the listing.  
   
 

### 00:50:36 {#00:50:36}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So like compatibility. So it will look into each competitor's listing based on those criterias and you know uh like the maintenance, filtration, uh dimensions, durability, uh lifespan, water clarity and it will show uh how many times the listing actually brings that uh issue there. not issue but uh you know the the feature. So right now it's just selecting all these uh features attributes and uh for each listing what what are they actually talking about. So let's say if we are looking at water clarity so we know we see uh okay so this guy is uh look it's uh mentioning removes dirt keeps water fresh safe for swimming this guy is looking for that so it's basically looking for benefits but uh benefits and features  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah. Okay. I tried it um last time on the filter balls. It gave me the same thing. It was very  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** interesting.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So then what once we have this is just uh uh we just compiling all these attributes in here.  
   
 

### 00:52:10

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So uh uh not only uh based on a uh so we just compiling them into one big section and what's important. So this is just a right now it's a it's a list of attributes that all the competitors are uh calling. So then we are going for what the customers are liking. So what do they like based on the customer's review and uh you know so perfect fit good quality and how many each uh each listing calls for for that and then we can uh you know select select the other ones as well. So then uh this section is just takes uh everything what was what was there and put it into a uh summary. Same with the customer what they don't like.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Sorry, Greg.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Same thing.  
**Todd McDaniel:** The attributes are they from uh reviews?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** No from the listings. Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** They're from the listings if if they uh if they appear in competitors listings.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Got it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** What's from the reviews? It's in here.  
   
 

### 00:53:38

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh, so negative attributes and then positive. So, now we just uh uh uh just summarizing this. So everything what's what's in here you can actually add yourself as well. So each section it can it can add uh so a lot of times I also get uh either chat GPT or uh other LLM system and then uh I go and uh create let's say for chat GPT you create a project and uh for each project you can actually uh teach chat GPT uh based on either category or on a product type. So let's say for for us for we have for each uh type of product uh we have a specific project where we upload the uh information about this this project itself so that when I ask chat GPT okay I'm identifying this this type of product right now can you give me ideas you know what type of customer. It is what uh what the dislike is and and uh and more more deeper uh deeper uh identifications. Chad GPT has very limited knowledge.  
   
 

### 00:55:23 {#00:55:23}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So you uh we basically switch completely to uh let's say to uh a aentic type of uh LLMs like cloud code and uh perplexity and the other stuff. So which allows you to go much deeper into uh uh searching the web. So, so then in this case it just uh yeah can give us more information. Uh  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay. Do you know why I Sorry.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** we'll  
**Douae Lahlou:** Do you know why I can't see your products brief? And also I guess you can see mine that I did on the um filterables.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** I think it's important to for us like to see if the product brief was done. Just not to redo it  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. The product brief you can see it here. So this is the complete you know once you press the pro uh the generate product  
**Douae Lahlou:** again.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** brief and you have I think for this account we have uh uh I think 10 I believe 10 per uh per month.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
   
 

### 00:56:41

   
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah. But just I  
**Todd McDaniel:** product briefs per month.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Sorry.  
**Douae Lahlou:** I  
**Todd McDaniel:** 10 product briefs per month.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** That's probably Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** but I also I I did one also and you can see in here I  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. So it's just it will create that product brief.  
**Douae Lahlou:** think  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So you you know it does not create a file. So you have to copy and paste into a you know Google doc or any word processor and then keep it uh you know for other analysis. So then you can upload this to a uh to other uh uh let's say I always take this convert this to a MD file and then keep it in a project and then uh give it uh as a resource file.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay, I got it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Douae Lahlou:** But you can only My question is that is you can only see the product brief you  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes.  
**Douae Lahlou:** done and not mine,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Uh I'm not really sure,  
   
 

### 00:57:43 {#00:57:43}

   
**Douae Lahlou:** right?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you know. Uh  
**Douae Lahlou:** Is I can't share my screen to show you. I I can see mine but not yours in here.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** okay. I thought I thought there is um everybody maybe there is a in a rights. We have to check this maybe later on, you know, with the with the uh rights for each listing.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm. Maybe.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. Let's let's continue.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Uh then once I have the product brief, then we can go to a listing builder. So the listing builder is just gives us uh few few different things. So like right right now uh I already completed uh this based on uh on the uh uh the product brief and some some other items that I pull out from from the web. But but the good uh you know the quickest start is uh so this one is already filled but let's say if we would uh start from the beginning so like right right now the item is just it will it shows you uh uh how your ranking juice.  
   
 

### 00:59:19 {#00:59:19}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So what what they call the ranking juice. So basically based on your keyword how many uh search volume are going through your listing. So and then uh class classifies them to uh for uh for all uh for all competitors and then gives you a score. So in in in this case in here all the listing so let's say uh right now after the modification uh applying to uh each section of the listing we can actually go from number 11 to number one. So, so currently your searchability is around uh 7,100 uh points. All other key uh competitors are higher than you. So that's why they are having a little bit more sales. So, by improving the search uh uh the searchability and the SEO for your listing, we can go from 7,000 to 23,000. And each improved section will give you some additional points. So to to show you how it looks uh actually on a uh on the listing itself. So the listing consists of the title uh bullet points and the description.  
   
 

### 01:01:14 {#01:01:14}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So description is product description in here. and uh the A+ content. But the A+ content uh it's just uh it take uh takes in into consideration uh later on because this one is like a uh uh integrated uh brand uh specific content that not every seller has the access to. So it it does not uh have any section over here. It's only uh we only are building the front end of the listing. So let's say the original listing has very vague uh bullet points. So we are allowed to put up to 250 characters into a bullet points. you barely have uh 50 for each bullet point and he just basically is very very cold very uh like for Rufus it doesn't give you any any value or even for for the customer. So right now we are trying to uh optimize the listing uh optimize the title to uh be as as much uh uh like keyword and uh Rufus related as possible and and include all the keywords uh that everybody else is running right now as well and ranking.  
   
 

### 01:03:03 {#01:03:03}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So when we when we are looking at at the uh listing itself. So this is already a fully optimized listing. So right now for all keywords uh I have uh basically moved a lot of keywords into uh the exact form. So you understand uh the difference between exact, broad uh broad plural uh keyword uh structure and the value of each keyword uh that is related to a specific keyword uh uh listing not keyword. So let's say let's say exact form of a keywords. So let's say if if we say exact we have to uh be in the exact form that the keyword is actually typed by a person. So if they are typing four words like this and the searchability for this specific keyword it has a number with it. So let's say 3,900 uh value points we have to be in the same uh exact form. Broad would be uh if we have those four keywords but in a different uh different uh places within 50 characters from each other.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Welcome.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So there is a certain logic if your keyword are still uh within that uh frame it will be treated as a broad search but the broad search is uh treated as a value for the listing.  
   
 

### 01:05:14 {#01:05:14}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** It's only let's say 40% of the uh of the value score but exact is anywhere from 80 to 100\. So exact form is the most valuable keyword phrase that it's uh bringing your uh the the ranking juice. So right now is just when we uh when we are uh trying to uh uh to get uh uh listing optimize. So first you can you can do it uh manually but they have a pretty good uh AI copywriter and it's a good starting point that uh gives you already uh uh an edge and then uh you can start from this and then take it uh to the testing uh stage. So you can run a test, an experiment on Amazon and then see if it's uh improving the listing and then uh manually adjust uh uh certain uh portions. So either a title uh or a bullet points or certain certain parts of the of the listing. So, what I always start with is just basically just run uh one of the uh uh one of the three. I think we lost to  
   
 

### 01:06:56 {#01:06:56}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Cool.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah, she's back.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Oh, sorry.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** We lost you.  
**Douae Lahlou:** I don't know what happened. Sorry. I'm  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** No, it's okay.  
**Douae Lahlou:** back.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So what I what I was saying is basically I start with the AI uh uh listing builder and then you have a three different uh options. So you have the Cosmo and Rufus. Then you you can uh optimize based on Cosmo only and it gives you some uh a little brief of uh you know what's included what's uh uh what's there and then uh so this is this is probably a year old or not even I think about eight months uh old that's why it's still in beta uh so that you can actually uh build based on the requirements of those uh two elements or first to start uh to uh uh based on the uh on the classic ones. So we uh just building the uh the listing uh to maximize the products ranking juice. So to get all the keywords combination and look at uh the all competitors and see where we can stuff the keywords to the uh best possible uh outcome.  
   
 

### 01:08:35

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So rather than yourself to come up with each individual item, this is just a really good starting point to uh uh to to to do this.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm. Sounds  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Uh I basically what I did in here first I run uh this one  
**Douae Lahlou:** good.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** the data dive classic and then once we had uh that classic one I I also run the Cosmo Rufus to see the difference and you know to adjust this a little bit. uh uh yeah ju just to adjust this and we can we can actually rerun this once again and uh I'll show you uh basically what's what's going to be uh the outcome. It's already 4:00. How how much time do you guys have?  
**Douae Lahlou:** No, I'm available if you guys  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Douae Lahlou:** are.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So it will take a little time.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay. So now you just it gives you a a review and now you can actually uh so I can I can keep the the same as I had but right now is just uh okay it rerun again based on a uh suggestions for this specific item based on the competitors and in all that stuff and then it just uh it Uh yeah it has some criteria the Amazon uh uh specific validators uh that you know let's say avoiding certain symbols and you know stuff like this against the toos.  
   
 

### 01:10:39 {#01:10:39}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So it will it will uh format the title to the latest uh toos and uh and then you know gives you an option to optimize to the best of uh yeah what we need. So right now there's not much uh changes because it's almost uh almost the same. So for the title, you can when you run the old one and the new one, you always have an option, you know, to keep it the old one and just just be with with the other one. But uh right now, let's Yeah, let's let's do that that one. Oh, that Okay,  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** so the old one had uh more ranking juice, so let's keep it uh here.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Then we go with the bullet points and when you first run let's say on the listing it will show you the the existing bullet points. So in your case it would show all these bullet points only few uh which basically uh yeah they don't. So we have replacement cartridge for saloo spa inflatable hot tub spas and right now the suggestion one is superior filtration premium spa filter for hot tubs that ensure crystal clear water compatible with the sulp spa hot tub uh Coleman hot.  
   
 

### 01:12:19 {#01:12:19}

   
**Douae Lahlou:** Much  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So it's it's already it's basically it's looking from the aspect of the what is  
**Douae Lahlou:** better.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** the customer looking for what type of phrases to to uh fit in  
**Douae Lahlou:** Nice.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** there and you know just uh it's so much better and then you can further uh do it uh you know with with some other uh things uh build a even even better one as well and then test this. So, you always have an option to have this one and test, but I wouldn't uh change too many things at once. Once you have the listing optimized, then you test one thing at a time. So,  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** even uh you know,  
**Douae Lahlou:** For for how  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** so depends what it is.  
**Douae Lahlou:** long?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Sometimes you know uh certain things will show you with uh let's say when we have the PPC and then we trying to rank a keyword it will show you within 24 hours if we are trying to rank but the experiments you will have to run for longer.  
   
 

### 01:13:30 {#01:13:30}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So the results will not be uh able to see maybe for a week or two  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** weeks. So that's why it's not worth in the beginning you know optimize the full listing release it and then see what what is the outcome is it improving or not and then you know if it is starting to uh and then you are watching your uh uh uh rank radar for all the keywords that you were doing before and what is what is the improvement. So let's say if we update the listing now okay so from tomorrow we uh really watch uh carefully what is the outcome and then treat each keyword separately.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Go.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So now in this view you just basically you have uh compar uh com uh you know comparable uh item to your previous listing and then gives you uh all the descriptions and everything you know what's what's there. And right now based on all these keywords from uh from 7,000 you're going to a 24,000 uh you know ranking juice where the best competitor has only 12,000.  
   
 

### 01:14:56 {#01:14:56}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So by by having those keywords built in and built in in  
**Douae Lahlou:** Nice.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** such a way that you know it's just it's a rules compliant, it's Cosmo compliant and uh yeah you're just taking them and putting them into uh your listing and see what what are the  
**Douae Lahlou:** Amazing.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** results.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Sorry. Sorry if I if I missed this, but so if you if you make a change, you're talking about monitoring if it's u you know made an improvement. Do do you have to manually keep track of what you changed or you just keep monitoring the  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** the dashboard and adjusting and you don't really need  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** to  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Once once once so let's say on a major improvement let's say if you improve the whole listing. So if your if your title is no good, description is very short, uh you have a ve very vague uh bullet points, uh yeah, so it's just everything is is changed. So then you know from that point on you're just looking at at the whole picture.  
   
 

### 01:16:08 {#01:16:08}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** But then you you uh checking the rank radar and see  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh you know what is the effect of my change and then individually you will be able to see so let's accept this and we will be able to see where are the changes because you know so let's say now we will be watching rank radar but also we will be watching at uh every single keyword. So this table uh so the top table it just gives you uh the like a working uh space to work on the on the uh word components bullet points title description and you know the the score. But this portion it will give you an overview of your keywords where they are and uh and uh and then compare this to your uh competitors. So let's say like right now we have all the main keywords most of them they are in exact form in the uh uh yeah in the title. So let's say so right now you can uh check the so let's say because that was uh only for the description.  
   
 

### 01:17:42 {#01:17:42}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So in the description you can filter based on the where the keywords are. So here is the full listing comparison table. So right now I can see the relevancy and you can filter based on relevancy based on ranking juice. right now is based on ranking juice and you know for this specific keyword we have in exact uh form in the title and all other key uh competitors they also have in the title. So right now the second one this one is in the bullet points but an exact form but none of the competitors have this keyword even though there  
**Todd McDaniel:** I I should I should mention, Greg,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** are  
**Todd McDaniel:** just on those two keywords, Artic Spa and Beach Comr, those are specific brands.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** yeah  
**Todd McDaniel:** Um, you know, competitor competitive brands for like the permanent built-in hot tubs.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah. So,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** they wouldn't be a compatible part. They they those two examples should pro should be excluded.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay. Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 01:19:00 {#01:19:00}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. So, we can we can exclude that. Yeah. That's  
**Todd McDaniel:** Um, so,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** definitely  
**Todd McDaniel:** so when you generate the new listing improvements,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Mhm.  
**Todd McDaniel:** can you can you upload from data dive or you just go into manually copy and paste into editing your listing within Seller Central?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you you you will have to you know individual listing. So you have two options. So you you can either copy and paste you know from uh uh from here to your uh editor in the list in your seller central or you can also generate uh uh the flat file. So once you have the flat file, you can just copy and paste into your flat file and then upload into uh into the seller central.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay. And is that I haven't done that. Um, and in fact, I've had issues submitting updates like in edit and then you know you submit and then it'll it'll give you a message that it might you know it's being reviewed and might take 24 hours and if there's multiple sellers they I don't know if I  
   
 

### 01:20:15 {#01:20:15}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** guess it's Amazon algorithm that's the gatekeeper on whether it thinks it improves the listing and accepts it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah, that's that's actually uh yeah, a lot of times you will have to pick up the phone and let's say call with with somebody.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** It's just because this is being uh you know taken over by the bot and then you know just com comparing you know is this compatible uh also it's checking your rights to the listing and uh you know each listing has  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh different uh rights to it as well and you know yesterday I uploaded one bullet points just to check if this will uh update and it did not  
**Todd McDaniel:** It didn't.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** update.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Have you Have you found is it any different using a flat file than uh any more success?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You know, it's it's quick. Yeah,  
**Todd McDaniel:** This is  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** with flat flat files sometimes they have more fields and you know you just  
**Todd McDaniel:** quicker.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** basically once you have a template is uh you don't all you have to do is just update your uh your template file and then you know change uh change uh one thing and then it's keeping everything in in or uh as a latest format  
   
 

### 01:21:46

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Thanks.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** because uh you know there are some programs even that they go into the listing uh on a timely set uh like a on a timer let's say every single day updates the listing to the latest format because it can be corrupted somebody can make a mistake so data can be lost Amazon can make mistakes and overwrite  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh some things there as well. So it's just uh yeah with the flat file is it's easier. So once you learn you know how to do flat files it's recommended to uh you know update every single listing with flat files even  
**Todd McDaniel:** Got it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** dates even uh images you know.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So it's uh because copy and paste it takes a lot of time especially when you have a lot of listings it's just uh you know and sometimes to update the full catalog uh yeah you would it would take couple of days to to update where in flat with flat file it will be just a matter of seconds.  
**Todd McDaniel:** I had uh I had updated the title on this listing a couple of  
   
 

### 01:23:09 {#01:23:09}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Mhm.  
**Todd McDaniel:** weeks ago. Um and it it and it was I think maybe a recommended title out of Jungle Scout or something at one time.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** And when I when I uh uploaded it like months ago, it asked me if I wanted to do an AB test of the  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Mhm.  
**Todd McDaniel:** previous title and the new title.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay. Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** I think I did and at some point I don't know what happened if it made the decision on its own but it reverted back to the you know the former basic title and when I went to I just had noticed it and went uh to update the title a couple of weeks ago. I tried it over the course of a couple of days and it, you know, it wasn't updating and I opened a ticket and then,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** H.  
**Todd McDaniel:** you know, the the rep on the other end just made the update for me and it's and then it seemed to there was no issue.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** So I don't I don't know if there's a if there is a rights uh you  
   
 

### 01:24:24

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah, it might it might be  
**Todd McDaniel:** know something is blocking it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** right.  
**Todd McDaniel:** But all all of like all of the all of these descriptions in the edit fields um if I save and finish they never seem to take so they're different than what's currently online.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Mhm.  
**Todd McDaniel:** And uh and once once in a while you know if I if I notice it or circle back and I have to open a ticket and and get somebody to do it, you know, for bullet points or for for for something. So I don't I don't know if it's specific to that listing or specific issue with your rights.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** It might be it might be listing listing specific uh but you might you might have a different rights that you definitely have a different rights than I do. So let's say I updated uh the this bullet point number three and it has not uh updated. So, so right now what we would do is just basically you would uh yeah pick up the phone and uh call them up and uh if one time does not work you know you call them up again and sometimes we have to call a few times and you know if the person on the other side is just does not know what they are doing you just drop the call  
   
 

### 01:25:41 {#01:25:41}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** and you know just make some noise that there's connection problems and you you looking for  
**Todd McDaniel:** Try again.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** somebody  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** else.  
**Todd McDaniel:** But but this this stuff is important enough to get it right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Oh, yes.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Keep keep calling if you have to.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. Oh,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Got it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** yeah. I'm telling you,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you just sometimes you sit four hours until you get uh something resolved. But if you if you can get the listing, you know, basically done the way you want it, especially these type of listings, you just uh yeah, uh it's it's a matter of, you know, uh uh making money and not making money.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Cut.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** especially in here. So I what I would what I would do is just basically uh uh yeah because in here there's many many issues you know for example uh you know all these keywords with the with the slash uh with the slash without any spaces.  
   
 

### 01:26:50

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I'm not really sure you know how many uh what's what's the value but probably they are not ranking at all and uh you know either we have with  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** a space with a vertical line or sometimes with the dashes uh and in our case I think we we had uh yeah with dash uh with  
**Todd McDaniel:** vertical line.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** a vertical line yeah in this in a space and  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay. In a space  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah, I would just uh you know take take this version and uh and go with it and uh and see how how we can how we can go about because you know there are many different rules sometimes even like right now because of the Rufus and Cosmo the uh uh even though there is a 250 characters allowed Before it was like a you know couple of years ago we were just keyword uh stuffing keywords. Uh right now it's more about the informing the customer or informing the bot you know what is the the full content of this of this uh uh product.  
   
 

### 01:28:11 {#01:28:11}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** It's like a almost like a writing a story and  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh and everything has to be connected and uh even so this is the first the front uh front end which is required uh mostly for the machine because you know probably 80% of the customers they won't read it you know they only will look for let's say certain keywords like the size confirming you know that this is specific size it will fit my equipment it will fit fit my uh stuff that I need and you know but a lot of times is just it will be images that it will tell them and confirm that this is this is the item that I need. So by by the uh time I'm looking at the image number three I should be already convinced to buy it and many many times on  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** mobile which right now happens uh uh 70% of the time people are searching on mobile uh images are more  
**Todd McDaniel:** Well,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** most important thing especially for for the  
**Todd McDaniel:** yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** conversion but you know This stuff is important because you have to you have to get the machine to uh uh to show your product.  
   
 

### 01:29:41 {#01:29:41}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So organically uh yeah Amazon is looking for all these uh items to rank you organically and uh that's why you need uh clicks, you need conversion. So you need people to click on this specific uh first they need to search for a keyword. Then they will need to find your item. Then they will need to click on the item and then uh they will need to buy the item and and the full erh travel throughout this process is being recorded by Amazon and gives you for each step they will give you a ranking juice. So more they click they will give you more conversion. uh uh if they add this to the c to cart, they will, you know, show you spec specifically to that item. And you can actually see this uh with the brand analytics how many people are adding to cart, how many people are dropping. And this is very specific to each item, but each keyword as well.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Cut  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So once once you have the right listing then you can optimize this even  
   
 

### 01:31:08

   
**Todd McDaniel:** it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** further you know by going into a brand analytics and getting really really deep to fully optimize and see what's what's the full story. But right right now this is the the the thing is to to give us the overall view for the uh for the listing uh for the title. So I'm just basically looking at all the competitors and uh monitoring each item and see okay if I'm ranking for for this specific keyword or you know a hot tub filter which is the main keyword then you know my title it is in the exact form but so is some main competitors like this one and that one which is already the the main one and uh and then I push more let's say uh PPC internal traffic or external traffic for this specific keyword and see how it work uh how uh improvement it's actually working towards  
**Todd McDaniel:** And exact exact keyword terms versus broad get a higher  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** waiting.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. If so let's say if I have the hot top filter which is included in exact form in a title and if someone uh let's say uh click on your item uh it will give for each route it will give some uh you know uh uh ranking uh points but mostly for this specific one because if if a person uh types uh in uh search and uh bar hot top  
   
 

### 01:33:18 {#01:33:18}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** filter for whatever but you already had this uh search term included. So if they if they write if they write a even a story, I need a filter. I need a hot tub filter for my jacuzzi. It's still and then they will find you. They will click on on the listing. They will add to cart. They will come back in two days. They will buy it. That's the most uh juice that you can get or if they if they buy it right away the same but uh it's actually they counting uh add to cards they counting you know different behaviors of the customer as well because add to cart it means to the to the bot that they are the customer is adding many other items. items and then finally after uh uh after checking them all they choose yours. It's not like a you know right away decision they click they  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Sure.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** buy.  
**Douae Lahlou:** So, this is an update for the listing and we're ready to proceed with this one, I guess.  
   
 

### 01:34:44

   
**Douae Lahlou:** But like, do we need to improve the images as part of the  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. the images is another another story.  
**Douae Lahlou:** updates?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So yeah, we'll we'll have to get the images uh into uh uh this the same type of analysis like right right now I kind of uh looked into uh a keyword. Uh so basically uh let me see if I update it here. So what I looked uh in here uh so first first of all just basically price price analysis you know very similar that we what we actually did uh before. So let's say uh so when you're validating an item uh you know for uh for future buy uh it's exactly the same when we are analyzing you know uh our uh numbers for you know on a monthly basis. Are we making money? Are we losing money? And we are uh when we have the listing going we have additional cost involved as well. So our item actually the price might grow if we are not selling this fast enough.  
   
 

### 01:36:22 {#01:36:22}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So if we keep this in a warehouse the warehouse fee is going to be adding on the top and you know all that stuff. So my my COC will be growing, you know, uh if I don't sell this fast enough. But right right now it's just I'm looking at the product economics uh you know what can we uh do uh in order to uh first of all compare what are we doing comparing to competitors? why they are having more sales uh versus us. So uh so first thing is just basically they have more sales because they bring more value to the customer. So our economics for the Tupac is basically we uh based on all the expenses and you know all the costs we are netting 441 which is 24 uh 24.5% margin but our uh filter price so let's say uh per per filter is uh no this one is uh just hold on. Okay. So in here for the customer. So right right now the per filter price compare comparison uh we are uh we are getting okay all the competitors that we analyzed.  
   
 

### 01:38:06 {#01:38:06}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay what what value they bring to the customer. So per filter because this guy is selling 16 pack for $56.99 and the price per filter is 356\. That's best value. Ours in comparison to others you know this guy is selling twoupack, 12pack, fourpack, sixpack and you are selling two pack. So for all the combination your filter one piece is $8.99. So to the customer uh comparing to 356\. So that's why many many customers is just es especially on Amazon maybe it's not valid for if they go to Canadian Tire or to a uh to the uh shop uh specific for for the filters or for the uh uh pools and you know all that stuff they already there they will buy uh without looking at the economics like uh under the magnifying glass. But at Amazon,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you have to treat this completely different. Price is the king and you have to adjust the price to to uh not to be the cheapest but to win on value. And so right now we're finding okay what's what is the problem?  
   
 

### 01:39:45 {#01:39:45}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So the problem is just we are not giving enough value. So perform uh and then uh we are just analyzing on the on the keywords. Uh so it will give us you know for uh this one. Yeah. So right now I'm just kind of a keyword performance analysis. So based on a the table that we had. So now we are taking a little bit more into uh okay what can we do what kind of keywords to uh really look into it. So right now uh the this keyword we are ranking number four. Even though this is competitor, it's still ranking number four. But uh but month monthly searches, it has only 660\. This guy, hot top filter, it has almost 3,000 searches, but we are ranking number 74\. So the main purpose is to make this item uh make this number closer to uh you know uh to the first page because you are with number 74 you are probably on number uh on page number three. So how many customers they will end up on page number three  
   
 

### 01:41:23 {#01:41:23}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh and buy? not too many. So you are already with this keyword which has brings a lot of searches you are already losing. So two uh these two uh keywords like right now the most valuable keywords that you can actually concentrate to bring them uh to the first page. So first idea is just bring them to the first page. So position let's say uh 20 and then you so uh and then uh bring them you know even further.  
**Todd McDaniel:** So what what's interesting so Saluspa is the brand is our brand so that like we should be number one and others shouldn't even be able to use you know that brand in their technically in their search terms you know the type six or  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** the in Roman numerals is the is the size and others  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** could say you know we have a type six filter Um but they must be also using Salpa in their keyword search.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So that's why that's why you just you go you go to your table in here and see uh  
   
 

### 01:42:46 {#01:42:46}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** where your sal who is using what if they are  
**Todd McDaniel:** Oh, see.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** using uh you know so let's say you can see it here.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So uh this this one so they are using in a title uh in a broad form. So they are using there. So what you can do as a brand owner or brand uh rep, you have rights to this uh uh brand. They they cannot use this keyword. So you're reporting them. You report every single brand to remove this keyword from the listing and enforcing them by uh reporting them into a brand registry.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So this is like a right now you have your property and you have to police it. You have to police the exactly the same way as you police against uh the  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh hijackers. So let's say for us for a a private label products because we are brand owners but exactly the same for you as a brand owner you have to police uh and prevent anybody else to take advantage of your uh of your sales.  
   
 

### 01:44:07

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So if somebody is breaking the rules which they are they cannot uh you know use uh brand names if they are not uh uh authorized for this.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Go  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So you can actually win all these keywords,  
**Todd McDaniel:** ahead.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** kick them out and  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Douae Lahlou:** So we can just open a ticket.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** and  
**Todd McDaniel:** Doesn't work.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Oh, sorry. So we can just open a ticket and report them,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** yeah, you just uh but you know be very specific, you know,  
**Douae Lahlou:** right?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you just uh like uh even uh with every single thing that uh uh uh that we are reporting uh we writing a really uh concisive message and not not like a you know just a I want to report this guy and this it's just we will tell them exactly why they are hurting us but also hurting the customer which actually brings another uh layer of protection you know always refer to uh you know that this is against the toos it's hurting the uh visual image of uh Amazon platform and you know some BS like this you know just uh you have to and you you don't have to come up with yourself it's just you know work with  
   
 

### 01:45:28 {#01:45:28}

   
**Douae Lahlou:** Got it. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** chat GPT and you can create custom GPTs I can show you later on you know that uh uh you know we have many different custom GPTs that you basically upload uh you know let's say a listing and then it will give you a uh uh exactly the type of letter what you have to write. So there are many different templates and there are some programs as  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** well. Uh I think we are using seller rice as well. Let's say for uh reimbursements that uh you know for any lost inventory for any lost money or for uh when Amazon is overcharging us for a specific uh uh product size and all that stuff. So there are already templates that we can uh send automatically to recoup the lost money. So let's say if they if they lose in a warehouse, why should we buy uh you know why should we uh pay for it? If the if the customer didn't receive the package, but there was a you know DHL confirmation number that they received us, why should we be responsible for that?  
   
 

### 01:46:53

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Amazon is responsible for that. So everything should be policed because that's that's a you know a negative to your bottom line.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** And uh if you don't report this uh and right now it used to be 18 months, right now it's only 90 days. If you don't do this within 90 days is just the money is  
**Todd McDaniel:** So,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** lost.  
**Todd McDaniel:** if we ship in 24 units and they say they only received 12,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** um, nothing will happen unless we log a report and fill out all the  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And they will they will ask you okay uh give me a proof that you bought this which is sometimes  
**Todd McDaniel:** traceability,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** is stupid you know yeah I'm shipping you yeah I didn't steal it but uh  
**Todd McDaniel:** right? All right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** yeah you have to give them a proof that you purchase then proof that uh you ship it sometimes stupid things but uh you just you just telling them what they want without arguing you just tell exactly  
   
 

### 01:48:01 {#01:48:01}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** okay here is this, this, this, this, and this. I need my money. And it will work. The same thing with uh with the uh listings. If you uh have like, you know, those two, I didn't even notice that, you know, this is just a a brand. So, Arctic Spy is the same thing.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Arct Arctic Spa and Beach Comr are both uh Yeah. brands.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah. And SP is our  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So, okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** brand.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So, that that makes probably sense because nobody else is using those keywords. Look here.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** But, uh, you know, for years,  
**Todd McDaniel:** So,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** everyone is.  
**Todd McDaniel:** yeah, they're probably policing them.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes.  
**Todd McDaniel:** People may be selling compatible ones,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** but they're policing  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So we have to make uh you know for uh bullet points we have to just remove uh those two keywords  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** but everything  
   
 

### 01:49:15

   
**Douae Lahlou:** to do so should sorry to do so should we go back to the MKL and exclude them or just from  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** no for MKL we can we uh you know right now is just uh you would just  
**Douae Lahlou:** here  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** go and uh because yeah edit edit uh uh  
**Todd McDaniel:** Just edit these manually.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** here in the listing.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So basically remove the keyword. So let's say you have a soul spot. So this is fine. But uh anywhere that we had uh uh those other ones I would just replace this with something uh uh different. And you know it just it's uh because here there is no uh there is no uh back and forth you know with it with this let's say uh listing builder you would have to just kind of take this at the side you know let's say chatgpt code or any other uh I wouldn't use probably uh you know other ones but you know let's say chat gpt or code and then you take this on the site.  
   
 

### 01:50:27 {#01:50:27}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I'm building a a listing here. Give uh you know as much information as possible and then you know and then give a really good prompt and uh change uh the the bullet points to remove that specific keyword uh to replace this with something else.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Got it. Just makes life  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** easier.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** And I built actually uh you know the same thing what what we built the for analysis right now I buil built also uh it's called for a clot code it's called uh skills so it actually takes uh uh this analysis and it analyzes it even further and takes this one it just and analyzes through uh through the uh various SOPs. So right now I was actually doing today uh and I didn't still finish completely. So there is no report but what we it will do it will it will get uh let's say all the information all the SOPs the uh all the toos uh what Amazon requires and what Rufus requires and uh all the information there and then optimizes it to uh uh to the best possible way.  
   
 

### 01:52:03

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So we can take uh actually this portion and uh you know improve  
**Douae Lahlou:** Beautiful.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** this even further but this is uh a good starting point.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So yeah, so it this actually gives you uh uh yeah,  
**Todd McDaniel:** great.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** all that stuff in here and uh yeah, what else? It's not mine. Um okay, so it's already almost five. I don't know. I don't want to uh know extend this even further but uh I can just quickly show you um okay so listing optimization Okay. So, basically, yeah, uh we're going into the product type keywords. So again uh it gives you some uh uh other keywords that are there there's some value you know 250 is not really that much but I see over over  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** and over again you that the type six filter and even right now a lot of a lot of competitors they put this on uh visually on the images as well just to get probably Cosmo to pick it up.  
   
 

### 01:54:20 {#01:54:20}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Uh and you know here is the uh French Canadian market. So I looked at th those as well. So with with those keywords so uh which can be improved as well. So the number one uh number so your rank is number six number nine number six it's already good position but it might be you know depends on it you know that one 250 uh we might we might improve on those because uh most of the time the number one to three takes the 80% of the uh sales maybe one to five.  
**Todd McDaniel:** So th this is all um organic searchability in the listing. And then if we were to do an ad campaign,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes.  
**Todd McDaniel:** we would we would look at essentially those same top keywords to to bid on,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Mhm.  
**Todd McDaniel:** right?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Same process.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Because right right now look at the uh uh let's say uh yeah look at look at this space so soul spa filter look how who is winning uh you know the space right now Amazon is selling you know right and left you know just for them organic is not really uh their concern.  
   
 

### 01:56:06 {#01:56:06}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** They want to sell real estate and right now the first  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh you know advertisement the biggest one uh pullpure takes the whole thing you know they are the best uh one of the best sellers and uh based on your uh on the MKL they are the red so is this one. So right now all we so first fault two rows are only sponsor ranking. So many people they don't even know what sponsor means. All they care okay bestseller batch and your item is basically number three in a category. So in a subcategory your item uh I'm not sure why is sponsored here.  
**Todd McDaniel:** We we do have a campaign  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Oh okay okay. Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** running.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay. So then then you know so basically a lot of times you know the top bar is uh really important and take uh a lot of good stuff. Yeah. But this position is is good as well. But then badges good that you have the Amazon's choice but then you know maybe some improvement on the on the uh listing itself on the image itself.  
   
 

### 01:57:34

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** You see this one is just for v visual differentiation just to give something different because right away red and with the uh v1 which is sex it tells you the the type but red is just you know just uh the image uh shoots you  
**Todd McDaniel:** All  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** a message okay here I I am choose me.  
**Todd McDaniel:** right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** It's like a flag. Uh but then okay. So we have right now uh organic. Yeah. So we are number one for this specific one. But that's also it's a a ge uh geol location driven based on the uh location where where we are. So let's say if I ch because right now I'm searching uh I'm searching this here from uh  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh Toronto area. But if I go let's say maybe to Quebec with the uh with the postal code from Quebec, it might be different because Yes.  
**Todd McDaniel:** is based on instock inventory at Amazon.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. So,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** it's actually geoloc but also driven on a how much stock do you have and where and if you uh if somebody is looking from Vancouver and you only have stock in Toronto and there's another seller uh or item very similar to this they will rank higher than you.  
   
 

### 01:59:25 {#01:59:25}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So that's why it's also important to keep recommended amount of inventory. So fully optimized inventory at all times. It's don't don't ever go to a you know to a almost out of stock. just uh it's better to spoon feed this the system as they want because every every time they will give you uh indication how much inventory they they need based on the on the impulses from the from the customer. If there's more uh demand for your product, it's just they have to be able to uh uh ship it in a most economical way for them because uh you know for them is just and also uh not only economical but also the fastest way because people  
**Todd McDaniel:** Like sometimes we'll see the the recommended order seems very large and so sometimes I go well I'm going to ship in a third of that or half of that  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** and then look at it again in a week or two because of some of the numbers.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** But maybe it maybe they see demand that we don't see because we've been out of stock in Western Canada and there's been demand or something like that.  
   
 

### 02:00:47 {#02:00:47}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Right. But when when I go to send in inventory,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** it will tell me which DC to ship it to. And sometimes it's, you know, Alberta or BC.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** You can't you can't choose or or overwrite that, can you? Like I always assume it's better to to ship it into Ontario because it'll it'll be there, you know, within a week hopefully. And if and then they might transfer it. Do those transfer costs get passed back to you if you know if we ship them?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** not not yet in Canada like in uh in US.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay. Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. you know that that's the uh uh additional fee that you will have to uh pay unless unless you are shipping uh five cartons or  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** more at the at the time they will drop that uh that fee but uh right now it's it's very expensive like you know the transfer between the fulfillment centers is is being uh uh you know put over to the seller like before like in Canada it's still Amazon is paying for that but uh I'm not sure when but it will  
   
 

### 02:02:07 {#02:02:07}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** happen.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Cuz sometimes I'll try to play with the quantities and I'll put 144 and it might say,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** you know, you need to ship it to Alberta and that could take depending on what time of year, you know, a month before it's received and in stock.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** But if I if I try to ship 48, then it might tell me to send it to Ontario or or vice versa,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** right? So um sometimes it's just trial and error to see get different  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. There are there are some uh rules and not rules but you know it's just basically driven by by  
**Todd McDaniel:** results.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** algorithm like before before probably a year before we used to use uh uh certain softwares that uh were able to push to uh uh certain fulfillment centers especially in US. But Amazon is cracking down all the loopholes and you know all the uh softwares like we were using this software probably for at least two three years until you know Amazon cracked them down and uh you know just uh yeah it's uh yeah the loophole is closed.  
   
 

### 02:03:27 {#02:03:27}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So until like right now I don't really uh know probably  
**Todd McDaniel:** right?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** there is uh still uh that software in operation but it's it's kind of too risky many times because you have to uh go into a gray area you know and sometimes it's not worth it you know with yeah  
**Todd McDaniel:** right?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** gray area sometimes is still okay but you know sometimes is very black area. So it's just uh you know you uh there are certain things that pe people or brands are doing illegally and you know taking the just the the risk and cancelling the orders and uh you know it's just uh because that's depends you know uh how much stock do you have a lot of times you just if you have existing existing stock let's say you are trying to ship additional 300 units and but you have in a stock 200 100 units. Uh so then it's different story for for the algorithm. So what what people are doing it's actually they they creating a fake order you know uh like removal order or customers order for uh and putting them on hold and then create a shipment.  
   
 

### 02:04:51 {#02:04:51}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Then it will bring to the same fulfillment center and then as soon as uh they they they get what they want they will cancel the other order and uh you know and then it's  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** just depends you know what what is uh yeah what's the cost sometimes you have you have to play  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** play with the numbers as Well,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh many times is just uh it's easier to create two separate shipments than com combining them into one because then they will give you two different fulfillment centers. It's just uh but in Canada is still not bad, you know, and the costs are still not uh not the not the same as in the US. Okay. So for for that one is uh yeah I also have here so first of all the uh keywords keyword gaps like we had French we have some uh top performing keywords but also I was looking at the uh uh the listing optimization evaluation and I looked at the whatever uh uh data dive gave us and uh also we had some uh deeper analysis for that.  
   
 

### 02:06:33 {#02:06:33}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So I think I had some new ones as well because it takes it takes actually the each part of the let's say the current title uh all the bullet points and then uh it it it uh goes to a little bit deeper based on Rufus and Cosmo and identified some a little uh loopholes as well. So for example the bullet points for this there are some issues or improvements that can be made uh so vague benefits ultimate filtration. So there might be some. So right now we are identifying the potential issues and we have to take this you know is just a take whatever uh the data dive uh gave us then analyzes further and then make a judgmental uh like a uh decision logical  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** decision.  
**Todd McDaniel:** And you're you're you're using uh claude or chatgbt to do this cloud code  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh this is this is purely cloth co code so it's using uh the  
**Todd McDaniel:** hook.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** latest Oppus uh 4.5 but with this one it's also because it it also connects to the external uh uh resources using the MCPS so I'm using perplexity as well so it will go out and search for certain uh keywords and then brings back you know some other results that let's say data dive was not able to uh uh to search for.  
   
 

### 02:08:29 {#02:08:29}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Cut.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So right now he's just identifying some some issues. Uh so right now and we have to just uh check  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** this out because uh right now the issue uh so for this one French keywords in English bullet should be back end only. Uh  
**Todd McDaniel:** No, not not mixed in with the English copy.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. This one is just a it's yeah probably because of the uh of the rufus that uh you know people are not mixing French maybe with English but from uh from the let's say algorithm perspective it might be okay and right now is uh so I I think there is a recommendation for uh for the uh new bullet points as well. But I wanted also to show you the uh multiplac multipac uh strategy and what we did in in here. There was a table somewhere. Okay. So what it recommends right now and maybe that's too much and it's basically uh you know uh it looks at this based on the number of units that is being sold and you know possibility of increasing uh  
   
 

### 02:10:12 {#02:10:12}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** Thank  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** revenue and margins as well. So like right now I I saw that there are uh even the filter is sometimes is losing money probably because of the PPC.  
**Todd McDaniel:** you.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So it will have to be PPC optimized but by by bringing the items uh like a multiack you increasing value to the customer because they have more options and more options they have they will stay longer on your listing and they buy one of the options. So many times is just the more choice equals more revenue and larger uh profits. And so right now we are analyzing you know for you know uh what is the price per filter if we go at the certain price and you know we're reducing let's say for fourpack eight pack and 12 pack. So we are not going to the cheapest but then we will have to just uh okay even with this 112 pack it will be still better value but then we have to position the listing and the item as a premium quality positioning. And then by by bringing this up in uh you know how we are presenting that item to both the machine and the and the  
   
 

### 02:11:58 {#02:11:58}

   
**Todd McDaniel:** So, so in that case,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** customer.  
**Todd McDaniel:** um, we've got our existing listing with a two pack as if we created a a 12-pack version. We could we wouldn't need to start from scratch with a new listing and no ratings and reviews.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** No.  
**Todd McDaniel:** We could add it as an option to the existing listing as a size or a variant.  
**Douae Lahlou:** option.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes.  
**Douae Lahlou:** I  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Is it a Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** think  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** And you can like Amazon is uh uh uh is doing like right now they are introducing a virtual uh variations. We used to have this even virtual variations years ago but then uh you know it's not profitable to uh you know the software companies and you know all that stuff. So we were doing a lot of times manually. So you can create actually a manual virtual uh virtual uh listing. But then the virtual listing unless it's done by let's say Amazon uh it will not be uh FBA.  
   
 

### 02:13:09 {#02:13:09}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So you will not have the same value for the customer because it will be uh FBM fulfilled by merchant and uh many customers they will not buy because you know be uh because of the first of all uh they will have to pay for the shipment because for you the economics will not work the numbers will not work. But if you are able to let's say even for now try uh package bundles locally but then it's economics related. So, is it worth it just to maybe to check this out? Even, you know, many times I do it myself, you know, from uh uh from home, you know, sending few pieces just uh you know, for this item, this item, this item, putting them into one pack in the envelope and then putting a sticker and then uh just check it out.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right. So would a virtual a virtual listing say a 12-pack these these are shipped into Amazon today in a case pack of 24 24 packs. Um would would a virtual listing of a 12-pack be the situation where Amazon is is bundling it and shipping it out out  
   
 

### 02:14:43 {#02:14:43}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** of the same master pack just a different pick quantity.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. Yeah. Yeah. That would be uh the case.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So, so they the carton of uh how many units is in the carton? 24\.  
**Todd McDaniel:** 24  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay. So, they are they are basically receiving a carton of 24 but uh then they  
**Douae Lahlou:** Therefore,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** are opening the carton and then individual is shipped to the customer. But what they would do is just for 12 pack they would just pack six pieces and uh that would  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yep.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** be 12 pack and uh you can do it a manual but then it's economically it's not uh worth it because you will have to create a FBM listing and fulfill this from from Amazon as a a separate order. So you can do it you know maybe for fourpack because then you will only  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** pay uh you know fulfillment fee uh once but if you uh or pickup fee so you will pick up two items they will charge you for two items uh but let's say for 12 they will charge you you know let's say 199 or 2.99 times uh 6 or 12 which doesn't make sense.  
   
 

### 02:16:04 {#02:16:04}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** it will add very very fast.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So a lot of times he's just you know pick uh kit creation by let's say if triumph can do uh kits you can actually uh ask them to okay let's create a fourpack or uh or eight pack even five of them and ship it to Amazon with uh only FNSQ label and then see how it goes. And just for a testing and then doesn't  
**Todd McDaniel:** So the current two packs have um UPC codes. Doesn't matter.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** matter don't worry because then then you would ask them to uh put this  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** into a not see through bag. So specifically that the uh the barcodes will not be able to scan through the back. So it cannot be clear but it it should be just basically white blocking blocking  
**Todd McDaniel:** Great.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** anything what's inside. put this inside, you know, secure it that it's it's not uh you know that it's uh that the package is uh uh smallest as possible and then put the label there just FNSQ label and that's all that's the easiest way to uh to uh test uh multip uh if you have the ability and anyone that has the ability uh to provide multip value uh you know items many times they increase uh revenue by by by two three fold.  
   
 

### 02:17:57 {#02:17:57}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So with this with this one is yeah you just uh we have uh yeah more more items in here. Uh so that that actually the the revenue uh and then it looks at you know the competition how much they are selling and you know the uh percentage of the breakdown you know so like right now even because of the pricing you might end up you know that your two pack it will because it's too expensive that the other ones it will uh sell the most especially the fourpack. And you can play with which which actually it's further down as well. We have different case scenarios that even uh you know because I think one of them uh I think the pricing was uh here $29.99 or $49.99 but still with the margins because the margins are higher than the Tupac you still have the room to uh to uh play with couponing you know. So let's say you can offer you know for some time $29.99 and give the customer 10% off which would bring to 27 something and you know we look at those items as well.  
   
 

### 02:19:29

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So we we actually have some uh uh for the yeah this one is the listing elements eight pack. So what what would have to be uh A+ content but there was uh yeah the savings how much the customers are are actually savings. So right now two pack no savings fourpack 17% if we offer this uh at uh 29 uh and then you also because this one is a good good point you know so uh Tupac gives them two two month supply four month supply full year supply but there was a section about couponing as well. Uh yeah, we have PPC campaign strategy as well. Uh and uh I also included like a 90day implementation road map. So specifically just uh basically what to look for, what to release uh uh when you uh do the soft launch uh what to use, what type of uh you know money to spend and uh you know stuff like this or uh you know because by by introducing new variations you will have to create. You don't have to copy you know the same two pack listing uh let's say A+ content you can replace the A+ content or you can create A+ content specifically to the variation.  
   
 

### 02:21:35 {#02:21:35}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So if you find that you know the 12 packs are buying let's say maybe a a business customers. So maybe you go with the A+ content towards more to a business customers and then you ad you advertise this to uh to your off Amazon uh customer base that they can buy to their stores. But then you adjusting the price with the business uh pricing.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So there's many different uh you know combinations that that you can you can play with that to increase the value to the customer. But to the major thing is to increase your profit and and many times is just by giving them more you keep more.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right? Like even the the 24 unit case pack would make sense for the business customer,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yes. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** right?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** And you know, you you don't have to sell, you know, many of them, but if you uh how many boxes you're sending each  
**Todd McDaniel:** Anywhere  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** time?  
**Todd McDaniel:** between 12 to 48 shipping in at a  
   
 

### 02:22:55 {#02:22:55}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. So even if you if you send five box uh let's say two boxes it's  
**Todd McDaniel:** time.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** already 24 unit uh you know 48 units is gone. It's volume game you know basically you just uh and also it it it clears out your inventory faster and uh you know and uh get gets your clicks get new customers to do your listings. So, it's a win-win-win situation.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm. So do we need to get clothe code also to help get this detail detailed report and optimization process for other  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah,  
**Douae Lahlou:** listings?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** like with with this one uh there are there are new versions of uh but I haven't I haven't really uh have you played with any of the clo or clo code.  
**Douae Lahlou:** No, not  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay, there is a pretty steep learning curve.  
**Douae Lahlou:** yet.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you know a lot of people is just uh because this is a CLI uh based so it's a it's a terminal uh based access so I'm using uh I'm using uh cursor or there's also uh few other platforms that you can use clo code or you can also there's a new version that uh you can access clo code from a desktop uh uh desktop version of code that uh it can be accessed this way but also they are coming up with a new uh new one it's called co-work but uh and  
   
 

### 02:24:49 {#02:24:49}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** many of the items are are fully comp compatible but this is just it's been just released like a week ago. So it's a very uh brand new product because uh they found they found a lot of uh people are migrating or uh you know getting into that space uh but they have problem with uh with practically with uh with that view. They are scared of terminals. uh you know I'm I'm coming up from uh I haven't done you know too much programming but uh you know uh I started with MS DOS so it's it's very very similar and you know  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** in the beginning uh but for me it was also difficult when I started because uh you know over the years you just uh you know all the windows and everything is uh is uh is different but once you learn uh I think this is the best way of using AI it's just  
**Douae Lahlou:** Interesting. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh like right now chat GPT I'm very rarely use very rarely using and we uh almost everything it's still you know we are we are checking this a lot of times because it's a it's a racing game right now between uh practically right now there's only few players including Chinese but uh you know here from North America it's uh uh basically chat GPT which has the majority right now of the market  
   
 

### 02:26:42 {#02:26:42}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** but then Google is right there and uh cloud code another so that that's the main trio And we have uh perplexity. And we have uh Chinese with a deep seek and manos which uh which also pretty good uh models as well.  
**Douae Lahlou:** I'll start getting familiar with it when I once I have a little time. But sorry,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** I have to be somewhere in like half an hour.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** No,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** it's you know I  
**Douae Lahlou:** So,  
**Todd McDaniel:** Thanks.  
**Douae Lahlou:** I just want to make sure like what's the next step? Like, are you going to go ahead and check what code says about the list optimization and then update the listening or we're going to do it together?  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah,  
**Douae Lahlou:** Next one.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** I think I think right now right now is just because I cannot update the listing. So, uh I can give you you know basically uh taken from uh either this report or taken from uh uh from the uh from the listing builder.  
   
 

### 02:27:57 {#02:27:57}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** we if we can update the listing to the latest and greatest you know uh title bullet points and everything and  
**Todd McDaniel:** All  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh and then work with Amazon to make sure that uh you know this can be imported because that's that's very important for other listings as well. So the same thing we we can do it for for the jumping castle for that  
**Todd McDaniel:** right.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh because since you have uh still inventory so why  
**Douae Lahlou:** Sure.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** not you know to uh to improve uh the listing and then and then if if anything because what's what's the uh case right now with the with the new order? What what is what would you like to do? Uh  
**Todd McDaniel:** Um, yeah. So, just I've been distracted with some other stuff and and D has been away.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Todd  
**Todd McDaniel:** I know Da you were working on on it a bit this week, right? Like so we've got that narrow down listing to review. I think we have to validate the the costs and and retails  
   
 

### 02:29:14 {#02:29:14}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** H.  
**Todd McDaniel:** um as a as a next step. We just got updated pricing on a LCL versus 20 foot and it looks like bumping quantities up to meet the 20 foot versus where we're at will make more sense. Um, but I think there's still a little work to do just around uh landing on the on the retails  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Todd McDaniel:** and validating the the profit margin on on those SKUs. And then we got to we got to secure that PO as soon as  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** possible.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So,  
**Douae Lahlou:** I don't think we Sorry,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** go ahead.  
**Douae Lahlou:** I was just saying that I don't think we have uh much time to go through the items I worked on. I just want to show you. I guess I could send it to you like today or tomorrow, but overall I have like 28 or 29 items,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** More  
**Douae Lahlou:** but like the bottle jumper has 20 12 variations, so those don't really count. And without those variations, I have like 18 items.  
   
 

### 02:30:20 {#02:30:20}

   
**Douae Lahlou:** But some of these come from like the previous selection like pit balls and chemical dispenser etc. So I don't know if Todd wants us to look still look at this or not but after you shared like the latest version I focused on items that hadn't been deeply dived and analyzed by you Greg.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** M  
**Douae Lahlou:** So I can send this to you today and look at it and we can discuss it like next week if you have some time.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** yeah what you what you can probably do as well which would uh help to uh let's say uh uh we can actually uh push this through uh the analyzer.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So so first of all you know just get the spreadsheet filled. I don't know if this is the same format as we as we did in  
**Douae Lahlou:** Um yeah,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** probably almost the same.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So yeah, if you if if you can uh fill this as much as possible, any notes, comments, you know,  
**Douae Lahlou:** That's what I did.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** the the things that you that you know or thought you know about anything that  
   
 

### 02:31:25 {#02:31:25}

   
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** is valuable for you know even f future uh uh like the like you mentioned B2B. So let's say selling to different uh customers.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** If you already selling to Canadian Tire and this will be a item that it's exactly at Canadian Tire or any other ones uh you know any information for that it would be very valuable and uh let's say if we can get uh you know instead of uh let's say uh pictures like this we can we can get the pictures uh as well but it would be easier for uh and that's what I would do the ne next time uh just do additional uh few columns and let's say get the Amazon costs. So if you just uh uh you know enter the uh cogs into that uh box and then fish out what is the Amazon fulfillment fee because any other information as far as the uh you know what is the uh  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** uh uh duties, what are the uh uh what else uh landed cost, you know,  
   
 

### 02:32:57

   
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** in Canadian dollars that we all uh need this data for, you know, the economics of the item. So if I have all the all the items uh there with the data with Amazon with uh data dive uh links we can actually quickly uh kind of a quickly relatively quickly to fish out all the dives and then download uh you know the keyword data and uh uh competitor data plus what are we selling the p uh the p the expected price that we are selling and uh Amazon's costs and then I can plug this in into the analyzer and see what we can get.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay. Yeah. In my insight you  
**Todd McDaniel:** the the Amazon costs are sorry do are they from the from existing  
**Douae Lahlou:** can  
**Todd McDaniel:** listings with Keepa is that where you're getting  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Uh no, you would just uh you would just go to the uh listing itself to the  
**Todd McDaniel:** the  
**Douae Lahlou:** in this box. Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** let's say if if we have already Coleman uh listing or you know and a mattress or a widget here.  
   
 

### 02:34:27 {#02:34:27}

   
**Greg Kowalczyk:** So I would just go and you know change the price to uh to the price that we think that we'll be selling to the expected price and then uh how much the landed cost is  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** and based on those two items we can get all the numbers you know the uh uh for for that fulfillment fee.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yep.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Mhm.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Okay.  
**Douae Lahlou:** I can definitely add this like in my insight. You can see let me see what I have. You can see like observation on pricing behavior, niche,  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Douae Lahlou:** revenue, listing structure, everything like visuals and benefits, competitor are actively pushing.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Mhm.  
**Douae Lahlou:** But I didn't include the fulfillment fee. I can add this for you and then Jud maybe can help me if he knows  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Yeah.  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah, give you some additional  
**Douae Lahlou:** uh some or see.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Because the data dive it will give you overall picture of that space and  
**Todd McDaniel:** comments.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** you don't have to if if you have multiple variations you just you know just pick up the the the most valuable one the most uh you know used or uh you know the the best that you uh think and then go with that one and uh you know and then the other one the other variation. So let's say if if there is a mattress and there are you know the mattress looks the same but there are different lengths or widths or thicknesses this can be a same listing but different variation  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay. Yeah, got it.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** unless we are selling you know thousands of units it's it's maybe maybe it's better to uh to separate them uh but to get the real estate. So let's say because if you have a listing with 10 variations, you will be only able to show one variation in the search uh uh box.  
**Todd McDaniel:** All right.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** But many many brands that are offering only let's say a mattress  
**Todd McDaniel:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** brand, they are uh offering each listing as a separate variation in order to increase the real estate and the search uh uh bars.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Yeah.  
**Greg Kowalczyk:** Okay.  
**Douae Lahlou:** Okay. Connect and look at it. Okay.
