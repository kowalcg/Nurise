## Your Action Plan (Next 48 Hours)

### **TODAY (Dec 13):**

**Step 1:** Send the email (EMAIL_Response_to_Todd.md)
- Copy/paste the draft email
- Adjust tone/timing if needed (it's Friday afternoon — he may not respond until Monday)
- Propose call times for Tuesday-Thursday next week

**Step 2:** Do your own homework (before the call)
- **Coleman Airbed Check:**
  - Search Amazon.com for SKUs: 90708, 90709, 90710, 90711, 90703, 90704
  - Check if Amazon Retail is listed and owns buy box
  - Screenshot pricing and competition for your notes
- **FBA Fee Calculator:**
  - Run high-cube items through Amazon FBA calculator (pool lounges, floating mat, pet pools)
  - Note storage fees if unsold for 90 days, 180 days
- **Quick Keyword Research (optional):**
  - Google Trends: "Coleman airbed Canada," "dog pool Canada," "camping sleeping pad"
  - Helium 10 or Jungle Scout (if you have access): Search volume for key categories

**Step 3:** Prepare for objections
- Review objection handling section in CALL_PREP_Quick_Reference.md
- Practice your Phase 0 pitch (2-3 minutes max)
- Be ready to anchor value: "If we kill 30% of bad SKUs, you save $15K-20K = Phase 0 pays for itself 3-5x"

---

### **MONDAY-TUESDAY (Dec 16-17):**

**Step 4:** Confirm call with Todd
- If he responds positively to your email, lock in the call
- Send calendar invite with Zoom/phone details
- In the invite body, include:
  - "Looking forward to reviewing your draft order and discussing Phase 0"
  - "No prep needed on your end — I'll walk you through the scorecard framework"

**Step 5:** Final call prep
- Print or open CALL_PREP_Quick_Reference.md
- Have NURISE_Product_Analysis_RedFlags.md open for reference
- Review your Coleman/FBA research from Step 2

---

### **DURING THE CALL:**

**Step 6:** Follow the script
- Use CALL_PREP_Quick_Reference.md as your guide
- Opening frame (2 min) → Red flags (10 min) → Opportunities (5 min) → Phase 0 pitch (5 min) → Q&A (10 min)
- Ask discovery questions (insurance quote status, margin assumptions, team skill level, target margin %)
- Close with next steps: "Does Phase 0 make sense? Ready to move forward?"

**Step 7:** Handle objections calmly
- If he pushes back on price: "Phase 0 is insurance against a $50K mistake"
- If he wants to skip validation: "That's what happened last time — let's get product selection right first"
- If he's hesitant: Offer a mini-audit ($500 for top 10 SKUs as proof of value)

---

### **AFTER THE CALL:**

**Step 8A:** If YES to Phase 0
- Send Phase_0_Proposal_Template.md within 24 hours
- Include a simple 1-page SOW (scope, deliverables, timeline, payment terms)
- Request 50% deposit ($2,250 CAD) to start
- Schedule kickoff call for Dec 18-20

**Step 8B:** If MAYBE (needs to think about it)
- Send a follow-up email summarizing the call
- Reiterate top 3 red flags you discussed (Coleman, trampolines, high-cube floats)
- Offer to send a sample scorecard for 5 SKUs as a "proof of concept"
- Set a follow-up call for 3-5 days later

**Step 8C:** If NO (not ready)
- Stay professional and positive
- Offer to stay in touch: "If you change your mind or want a second opinion before locking the order, I'm here"
- Ask if you can send a quick email in January to check in (after the order is locked)
- Don't burn the bridge — he may come back after he makes mistakes

---

## Key Talking Points (Memorize These)

### **The Problem:**
"Todd, you're about to commit $50K to a container. If we get product selection wrong, you'll spend the next 12 months trying to unload dead inventory — just like last time. The problem isn't execution, it's product selection."

### **The Solution:**
"Phase 0 is a $4.5K insurance policy against a $50K mistake. We scorecard every SKU, kill the bad ones, and make sure your capital goes to products that can actually make money on Amazon.ca."

### **The Value:**
"If we kill 30% of the bad SKUs in this order, you just saved $15K-20K in dead inventory and storage fees. Phase 0 pays for itself 3-5x in year one."

### **The Decision:**
"After Phase 0, you decide. Option 1: Take the scorecard and run with it yourself. Option 2: Continue to setup, training, and launch support (Phase 1-3). No obligation either way."

## Red Flags to Emphasize (Top 5)

1. **Coleman Airbeds** = Amazon Retail threat (if Amazon owns buy box, pricing is destroyed)
2. **Trampolines** = Insurance costs unknown (could kill margin before launch)
3. **High-Cube Pool Floats** = Storage fee death (Everluxe Floating Mat = 0.802 CBM per unit)
4. **90% Summer Products** = Seasonal concentration (unsold inventory Sep-Feb = storage fees)
5. **Too Many 2026 NEW SKUs** = No sales data (guessing on quantities = inventory risk)

---

## Opportunities to Build Confidence (Top 3)

1. **Swim Accessories** = Safest category (low cube, year-round, 0% duty, zero PLI risk)
2. **TPU Sleeping Pads** = Growing outdoor market (low cube, year-round, less competitive)
3. **Pet Products** = Niche with less competition (dog owners = loyal buyers, TikTok viral potential)

---

## Pricing Quick Reference

**Phase 0 Only:** $4,500 CAD (what you're pitching on this call)

**Full Engagement (if he asks):**
- Phase 0: $4,500 CAD
- Phase 1: $6K-8K CAD
- Phase 2: $8K-10K CAD
- Phase 3: $5K-7K CAD
- **Total:** $23.5K-29.5K CAD

**→ Lead with Phase 0. Don't pitch the full $25K-30K unless he asks.**

---

## Timeline Reminder

**Todd's Constraint:** March 10 ship date from factory
- Needs to lock order by early January (Jan 5-10)
- Phase 0 must complete by January 3-5 to allow decision time
- That means start Phase 0 week of December 16 (next week)

**Your Timeline:**
- Friday, Dec 13: Send email
- Tuesday-Thursday, Dec 17-19: Call with Todd
- Friday, Dec 20 (or Monday Dec 23): Send Phase 0 proposal if YES
- Kickoff Phase 0: Dec 23-27 (Christmas week = light, but doable)
- Final Phase 0 review: Jan 2-3
- Todd locks order: Jan 5-10

**→ There's urgency here. Use it: "We need to start Phase 0 next week to give you time to lock the order by early January."**

---

## Objection Handling Cheat Sheet

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"Can we just order what we have and fix it later?"** | "You could, but that's what happened last time. If we fix product selection now, everything else gets easier." |
| **"I don't have budget for consulting."** | "If you order $50K and 30% is dead inventory, you just lost $15K. Phase 0 costs $4.5K and prevents that loss." |
| **"My team can figure this out as we go."** | "They might, but it'll cost 6-12 months and $10K-20K in tuition fees. Phase 0 compresses that into 2 weeks." |
| **"What if we just order small quantities?"** | "Small quantities help, but better to kill bad SKUs entirely and reallocate capital to winners." |
| **"Can you just manage our PPC instead?"** | "PPC won't save bad product selection. Let's validate the products first, then we can talk about ongoing support." |

## What Success Looks Like

**End of this engagement (Jan 3):**
- Todd has a clear GO/HOLD/KILL list for all SKUs in his draft order
- Todd knows exactly which products to order (and why)
- Todd has validated margins with ALL costs included (no surprises)
- Todd has avoided $15K-20K in dead inventory mistakes
- Todd decides whether to continue to Phase 1-3 or run with it himself

**Your Win:**
- $4.5K Phase 0 fee (with potential for $20K-25K more if he continues to Phase 1-3)
- Case study: "Helped Nurise avoid $15K in dead inventory by killing bad SKUs before ordering"
- Long-term client relationship (ongoing support retainer, future SKU launches, US market expansion)
