# Nurise Ecommerce Relaunch — Consulting Framework

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 13, 2025
**Client:** Nurise Group (Todd McDaniel)

---

## Executive Summary

**The Problem:**
Todd's agency lost money on their first Amazon/Walmart.ca attempt due to poor product selection (high cube, seasonal, competitive, high insurance). They're ready to commit ~$50K USD to a mixed container but need validation BEFORE capital deployment.

**The Goal:**
Relaunch profitably with:
- Validated product selection
- Correct Amazon.ca setup from day one
- Internal team capability (not permanent outsourcing)
- SOPs and systems for scale

**The Approach:**
Phased engagement that front-loads risk reduction, builds systems, then hands off execution to internal team with support guardrails.

---

## Phase Structure

### **PHASE 0: Product Validation & Kill List** *(Week 1-2)*

**Objective:**
Prevent the $50K mistake. Score every SKU objectively and create a GO/HOLD/KILL list BEFORE the container order is locked.

**Deliverables:**
- Product Validation Scorecard (all SKUs scored)
- Final GO list with projected margins and risk flags
- KILL list with clear reasoning (share with factories diplomatically)
- Revised container order plan (quantities, mix, risk mitigation)
- Launch sequence priority (which SKUs to activate first)

**Decision Gate:**
Client approves final GO list and understands margin/risk of each SKU. No order placed until this is signed off.

**Why This Matters:**
This is where the money gets saved. If you kill 40% of the SKUs before ordering, you just prevented 6-12 months of bleeding cash on dead inventory.

---

### **PHASE 1: Foundation Setup** *(Week 3-4)*

**Objective:**
Set up Amazon Seller Central and Walmart.ca infrastructure correctly the first time. Build the operating system before inventory arrives.

**Deliverables:**
- Amazon.ca Seller Central audit and optimization
  - Account health check
  - Brand Registry validation (Bestway)
  - Tax/compliance setup (GST/HST, provincial sales tax)
  - Fulfillment settings (FBA multi-channel if needed)
- Walmart.ca setup review (2P DSV vs Marketplace decision)
- Listing templates (title, bullets, backend keywords, images)
- Pricing framework (repricing logic, MAP policies, promo strategy)
- PPC account structure (campaign blueprint, not live yet)
- Reporting dashboard setup (margin tracker, inventory velocity, ACOS)

**Decision Gate:**
All systems are built and tested in sandbox/draft mode. Team understands how each piece works. Ready for inventory to arrive.

**Why This Matters:**
You can't fix a bad foundation after launch. Listings, pricing logic, and ad structure must be right from day one or you burn budget learning what you should have known.

---

### **PHASE 2: Launch Execution & Team Training** *(Week 5-8)*

**Objective:**
Activate the first wave of SKUs, train Todd's internal team member on execution, establish SOPs for daily/weekly operations.

**Deliverables:**
- First SKU wave live (prioritized from Phase 0)
- Listing optimization (A+ Content, Enhanced Brand Content if applicable)
- PPC campaigns launched (manual and auto, conservative budgets)
- SOP Documentation:
  - Listing creation checklist
  - PPC launch playbook
  - Inventory replenishment workflow
  - Weekly performance review template
  - Profitability calculation sheet (all-in cost to true margin)
- Team Training Sessions (3-4 live working sessions):
  - Session 1: Listing optimization and backend setup
  - Session 2: PPC campaign structure and daily management
  - Session 3: Reporting, margin analysis, and decision triggers
  - Session 4: Inventory forecasting and reorder logic

**Decision Gate:**
Todd's team member can execute daily tasks independently. First 30 days of sales data shows margin targets are achievable. Ready to scale to next SKU wave.

**Why This Matters:**
This is where you transfer knowledge, not just do the work. If Todd's team can't run this after Phase 2, you've failed the engagement goal.

---

### **PHASE 3: Optimization & Scale Readiness** *(Week 9-12)*

**Objective:**
Optimize live campaigns, validate margin assumptions with real data, prepare for scale (US market, additional SKUs, Shopify storefront).

**Deliverables:**
- PPC optimization (keyword pruning, negative lists, bid adjustments)
- Margin reality check (actual vs projected, fee audit, cost reconciliation)
- Inventory velocity analysis (reorder triggers, safety stock levels)
- Scale readiness assessment:
  - Which SKUs earned the right to scale?
  - Which SKUs need tweaks or should be killed?
  - What's the playbook for US market expansion (if applicable)?
- Shopify storefront decision framework (worth it vs Amazon/Walmart only?)
- Ongoing support SOP (when to call consultant vs handle internally)

**Decision Gate:**
Client has 90 days of sales data, knows what's working, and can make informed decisions about:
- Reorder quantities for next container
- US market expansion timing
- Additional SKU launches
- Whether Shopify storefront makes economic sense

**Why This Matters:**
This is where you prove the system works. If margins hold and the team is confident, you've de-risked the business and built a sustainable engine.

## Product Validation Scorecard Framework

### **Scoring System (1-5 scale, 5 = best)**

#### **1. Margin After All Fees**
- **5:** >35% net margin after all Amazon fees, FBA, shipping, insurance, returns
- **4:** 25-35% net margin
- **3:** 15-25% net margin
- **2:** 10-15% net margin (caution zone)
- **1:** <10% net margin (KILL)

**Calculation Checklist:**
- Landed cost (DDP to 3PL)
- Amazon referral fee (8-15% depending on category)
- FBA fulfillment fee (dimensional weight, size tier)
- FBA storage fee (monthly + long-term if seasonal)
- Insurance (PLI if product has liability risk)
- Returns/damage allowance (3-5% for inflatables, 1-2% for hard goods)
- Payment processing (if applicable)
- PPC cost (assume 10-15% of revenue initially)

---

#### **2. Competition & Amazon Retail Risk**
- **5:** <20 sellers, no Amazon Retail presence, weak listings, low review counts
- **4:** 20-50 sellers, no Amazon Retail, some strong competitors
- **3:** 50-100 sellers, Amazon Retail NOT active but purchased in past (pink flag)
- **2:** 100+ sellers OR Amazon Retail active in US (high risk Canada follows)
- **1:** Amazon Retail owns buy box in Canada or known price cutter (KILL)

**Red Flags:**
- SKUs marked "pink" in Todd's sheet (Amazon.com purchased '24/'25/'26)
- Amazon Retail buy box ownership >30% of time
- Race-to-bottom pricing (sellers dropping below MAP/profitability)

---

#### **3. Seasonality**
- **5:** Year-round demand, minimal seasonal variance
- **4:** Light seasonal bias (20-30% variance), manageable with inventory planning
- **3:** Moderate seasonal (50%+ variance, clear peak season)
- **2:** Highly seasonal (80%+ sales in 3-4 months, long-term storage risk)
- **1:** Single-season product (storage fees eat margin, liquidation risk)

**Todd's Risk:**
Spring/summer products (pool floats, inflatables) = long-term storage Aug-Feb if they don't sell. Need to model storage fees and liquidation plan.

---

#### **4. Cube / Logistics Complexity**
- **5:** Small, lightweight, low cube (easy FBA inbound, low storage fees)
- **4:** Medium size, manageable dimensional weight
- **3:** Bulky but shippable (pool floats, air furniture)
- **2:** High cube, awkward dimensions (storage fees escalate quickly)
- **1:** Oversized, fragile, or requires special handling (KILL unless margin justifies)

**FBA Size Tiers:**
- Small standard: <12 oz, <15" longest side
- Large standard: <20 lbs, <18" on longest side
- Oversize: Everything else (fees spike dramatically)

---

#### **5. Insurance & Compliance Risk**
- **5:** Low risk (hard goods, no PLI concerns, no compliance barriers)
- **4:** Minimal PLI exposure (low injury risk, standard product)
- **3:** Moderate PLI (inflatables, water products, supervised use items)
- **2:** High PLI (trampolines, pressure products, unsupervised use)
- **1:** Prohibitive insurance costs or compliance issues (KILL)

**Todd's Pain Points:**
- Previous "Leap and Play constant air" item = high insurance costs
- Mini trampolines, inflatables, pool products = need PLI quotes BEFORE ordering
- Licensed goods (Coleman) = verify licensing agreements allow Amazon sales

---

#### **6. Velocity vs Inventory Risk**
- **5:** High BSR (<5,000 in category), fast turn, low MOQ from factory
- **4:** Moderate BSR (5,000-20,000), predictable turn, manageable reorder lead time
- **3:** Slower BSR (20,000-50,000), need to test demand before scaling
- **2:** Unproven or low BSR (>50,000), high inventory risk if it doesn't sell
- **1:** No sales rank data, completely new ASIN, or dead category (test small or KILL)

**Test Buy Strategy:**
- First container = LOW quantities of unproven SKUs (50-100 units max)
- Proven SKUs (existing Amazon sales data) = can order higher quantities
- Reorder after 30-60 days of velocity data

---

### **Scorecard Output: GO / HOLD / KILL**

**Scoring Thresholds:**
- **24-30 points:** GO — Low risk, strong margin, prioritize for first launch wave
- **18-23 points:** HOLD — Needs tweaks (pricing, quantity, timing) or more data
- **12-17 points:** CAUTION — Only if strategic (brand presence, bundle opportunity)
- **<12 points:** KILL — Do not order, too many red flags

**Example Scorecard Row:**

| SKU | Product | Margin | Competition | Seasonality | Cube | Insurance | Velocity | **Total** | **Decision** |
|-----|---------|--------|-------------|-------------|------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 67001 | Coleman Airbed Queen | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4 | **23** | **HOLD** — Test 100 units, validate margin assumptions |
| 58292 | Inflatable Pool Float | 2 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | **12** | **KILL** — Seasonal, competitive, thin margin, high cube |
| Pet Bed Example | TPU Pet Mat | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | **28** | **GO** — First launch wave, scale quickly if margin holds |

---

## Fee & Scope Positioning

### **Pricing Philosophy**

**Avoid:**
- Hourly billing (incentivizes slow work, no value anchor)
- Long-term execution retainers (creates dependency, not capability building)
- Percentage of sales (misaligned incentive, client wants profit not revenue)

**Use:**
- **Fixed-fee phases** (pay for outcomes, not hours)
- **Value-based pricing** (anchor to risk reduction and system value)
- **Support retainer (optional)** after handoff (for scale milestones, not daily ops)

---

### **Proposed Fee Structure**

#### **Phase 0: Product Validation & Kill List**
**Fee:** $3,500 - $5,000 CAD
**Value Anchor:** "If we kill 10 bad SKUs before you order, we just saved you $15K-25K in dead inventory and storage fees over the next 12 months. This phase pays for itself 3-5x."

**What's Included:**
- Scorecard analysis of all SKUs in container plan
- Margin modeling (landed cost to true net profit)
- GO/HOLD/KILL recommendations with reasoning
- Revised order plan with quantities and risk mitigation

**Decision Point:** Client can stop here if they want. No obligation to continue to Phase 1-3.

---

#### **Phase 1: Foundation Setup**
**Fee:** $6,000 - $8,000 CAD
**Value Anchor:** "Most Amazon sellers lose $10K-20K in the first 90 days because of bad listings, wrong PPC structure, or fee surprises. We build it right the first time so your launch budget goes to sales, not mistakes."

**What's Included:**
- Amazon.ca and Walmart.ca infrastructure setup
- Listing templates and optimization framework
- Pricing and repricing logic
- PPC campaign blueprint (not live management)
- Reporting dashboard (margin tracking, inventory velocity)

---

#### **Phase 2: Launch Execution & Team Training**
**Fee:** $8,000 - $10,000 CAD
**Value Anchor:** "This is where we transfer the knowledge. Your team member will be able to run daily ops independently after this phase. You're paying to build a system, not rent a manager."

**What's Included:**
- First SKU wave activation (listings, PPC launch)
- SOP documentation (listing creation, PPC management, inventory, reporting)
- 3-4 live training sessions (hands-on, working sessions)
- 30-day launch support (Slack/email access for questions)

---

#### **Phase 3: Optimization & Scale Readiness**
**Fee:** $5,000 - $7,000 CAD
**Value Anchor:** "After 90 days, we audit the real data and tell you what's working, what to kill, and how to scale. This is where you decide if US expansion or Shopify makes sense based on evidence, not guesses."

**What's Included:**
- PPC optimization (keyword pruning, bid adjustments)
- Margin reality check (actual vs projected)
- Inventory velocity analysis and reorder triggers
- Scale readiness assessment (US market, Shopify, SKU expansion)
- Handoff documentation (when to call consultant vs DIY)

---

#### **Optional: Ongoing Support Retainer** *(Post Phase 3)*
**Fee:** $1,500 - $2,500/month (3-6 month commitment)
**Scope:** Ad-hoc support for:
- New SKU launches
- US market expansion planning
- Quarterly performance audits
- PPC troubleshooting (not daily management)
- Scale milestone coaching (e.g., $50K/mo → $100K/mo)

**NOT Included:**
- Daily PPC management (team does this)
- Listing creation (team does this using SOPs)
- Customer service or account health firefighting

---

### **Total Investment (Phase 0-3):**
**$22,500 - $30,000 CAD**

**Payback Calculation for Todd:**
- Container order: $50K USD (~$67K CAD)
- If product validation (Phase 0) prevents 30% bad SKUs: **$20K saved**
- If proper setup (Phase 1-2) prevents 90-day launch mistakes: **$10K-15K saved**
- If team training (Phase 2-3) eliminates need for 6-12 months of agency fees at $3K-5K/mo: **$18K-60K saved**

**Total Value Delivered:** $48K - $95K
**Total Investment:** $22.5K - $30K
**ROI:** 2-3x in first 12 months (conservative)

---

## Key Decision Gates (Summary)

| Phase | Decision Gate | What Happens If "No" |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Phase 0** | Client approves GO list and understands risk/margin of each SKU | Container order is revised or paused until concerns addressed |
| **Phase 1** | All systems built and tested, team understands infrastructure | Don't launch until foundation is solid (avoid costly fixes later) |
| **Phase 2** | Team can execute daily tasks independently, margins validate in first 30 days | Extend training, troubleshoot margin issues before scaling |
| **Phase 3** | 90-day data shows which SKUs work, team confident to scale or expand | Pause scale plans, kill underperformers, refine before next container |

---

## What Success Looks Like (90 Days Post-Launch)

**Metrics:**
- **Margin:** 20-30%+ net profit after all fees (validated with real sales data)
- **Inventory Turn:** 60-90 day sell-through on GO SKUs (no long-term storage fees piling up)
- **Team Capability:** Todd's team member runs daily ops without consultant hand-holding
- **Kill Discipline:** 20-40% of initial SKUs killed or paused based on data (not ego)
- **Scale Readiness:** Clear plan for next container, US expansion, or Shopify based on evidence

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- Margins shrinking due to PPC costs or price compression
- Inventory sitting >90 days (storage fees eating profit)
- Team still dependent on consultant for basic tasks
- Launching more SKUs before validating current ones

---

## Consultant Positioning (How to Present This)

### **Opening Frame:**
"Todd, based on our conversation, the biggest risk isn't that you don't know Amazon — it's that you commit $50K to the wrong products and spend the next 12 months trying to get out of them. That's what happened last time.

Here's how I'd approach this differently:

**Phase 0 is where we save you money** by killing the bad SKUs before you order them. If we cut 30% of the container plan, we just saved you $15K-20K in dead inventory.

**Phase 1-2 is where we build the system** so you launch correctly and your team learns how to run this without needing me forever.

**Phase 3 is where we validate the data** and make smart decisions about scale — US market, Shopify, next container — based on what actually worked, not what we hoped would work.

This isn't about me managing your Amazon account. It's about building a system your team can run, and making sure you don't waste capital on products that won't work."

---

### **Handling Common Objections:**

**"Can we just do Phase 0 and see how it goes?"**
"Absolutely. Phase 0 is standalone. If you just want the product validation and scorecard, we can stop there and you take it from there. But most clients realize that if the product selection is right, they want the setup done correctly too — and that's Phase 1-2."

**"Why not just charge a percentage of sales?"**
"Because you don't need revenue, you need profit. If I'm incentivized on sales, I might push you to launch SKUs that do volume but kill your margin. I'd rather get paid to build a system that makes you 25% net profit on $30K/month than 10% net profit on $100K/month."

**"What if we need ongoing help after Phase 3?"**
"That's what the optional support retainer is for — but it's for scale milestones and troubleshooting, not daily management. If I'm still doing your daily PPC in month 6, I failed the engagement. The goal is for your team to run this."

**"Can you just manage our PPC and listings for us?"**
"I could, but that's not what you need. You need to build internal capability so you're not dependent on an agency forever. I'll teach your team how to do this, give them the SOPs, and be available when they hit a wall — but they should be doing the day-to-day work by month 3."

---

## Immediate Next Steps (For Greg)

1. **Send this framework to Todd** with a note:
   - "Here's how I'd structure the engagement based on what you shared. Phase 0 is the critical piece — let's validate the product list before you commit the capital."

2. **Propose a 30-min follow-up call** to:
   - Walk through the scorecard framework
   - Answer questions on fee structure
   - Align on timeline (March ship date is tight — need to start Phase 0 ASAP)

3. **Ask for the product list in a readable format** (CSV or Google Sheet) so you can start scoring SKUs in Phase 0

4. **Set expectations on timeline:**
   - Phase 0: 1-2 weeks (need to finalize container order by early Jan to hit March ship)
   - Phase 1: 2-3 weeks (build systems while container is in transit)
   - Phase 2: 4-6 weeks (goods arrive end of April, launch in May)
   - Phase 3: Ongoing through July-Aug (optimize based on spring/summer sales data)

---

## Final Thought

Todd's biggest risk is repeating the last mistake: committing capital to products that don't work on Amazon. **Phase 0 is the highest-value phase** because it prevents the $50K mistake.

The rest of the engagement is about doing it right and building capability — but if the products are wrong, none of that matters.

Lead with risk reduction, not with "I'll manage your Amazon account." That's the positioning that wins this deal and delivers value.

**End of Framework**
