## Executive Summary

Todd's draft order contains **significant risk concentrations** that need immediate validation before committing capital:

**Major Risk Flags:**
1. Heavy seasonality bias (spring/summer products dominant)
2. Multiple high-cube/low-density items (storage fee exposure)
3. Coleman airbeds = Amazon Retail risk (likely already listed on .com, will migrate to .ca)
4. Pool products = insurance/PLI exposure (trampolines, pet pools, inflatables)
5. Many 2026 NEW items = no sales rank data = inventory risk

**Key Opportunities:**
1. Pet category (growing, less competitive than pool toys)
2. TPU sleeping pads (year-round, outdoor/camping trend, lower cube)
3. Swim accessories (caps, dive toys, nose clips) = low cube, low insurance, year-round pools
4. Beach balls and play products = replenishment items, low controversy

**Recommended Approach:**
- **Phase 0 scorecard CRITICAL** before order lock
- Kill or reduce quantities on high-cube seasonal items
- Validate Coleman airbed competitive landscape (Amazon Retail presence)
- Get PLI insurance quotes on trampolines and pet pools BEFORE ordering
- Prioritize low-cube, year-round, proven SKUs for first wave

## Product Category Breakdown

### 1. **Coleman Airbeds** (HIGH RISK — Amazon Retail Threat)

**SKUs in Order:**
- 90708: SupportRest Plus Twin (75"x38"x16") w/ AC Pump - Qty: 2 cartons
- 90709: SupportRest Plus Queen (80"x60"x16") w/ AC Pump - Qty: 1 carton
- 90710: GuestRest Twin (75"x38"x18") w/ Built-in Pump - Qty: 2 cartons
- 90711: GuestRest Queen (80"x60"x18") w/ Built-in Pump - Qty: 1 carton
- 90703: Quickbed Twin (75"x38"x10") - Qty: 4 cartons
- 90704: Quickbed Queen (80"x60"x10") - Qty: 3 cartons

**Todd's Note:** "Coleman airbeds is an interesting opportunity as we have just taken over the license from Coleman which is a highly regarded and well-known brand."

**CRITICAL RED FLAGS:**
- **Amazon Retail Risk:** Coleman is a major brand. High probability Amazon.com already lists these SKUs or will soon.
  - **ACTION:** Search Amazon.com for these exact model numbers (90708, 90709, etc.)
  - If Amazon Retail owns buy box on .com, they WILL migrate to .ca and destroy pricing
- **Airbed Category = Brutal Competition:**
  - Intex, Coleman, AeroBed all fight for share
  - Race-to-bottom pricing common (MAP violations)
  - High return rates (leaks, pump failures) = 5-10% margin hit
- **Seasonality:** Airbeds spike during moving season (May-Sept), camping season (June-Aug), holiday guests (Nov-Dec)
  - Risk: Unsold units Aug-Nov = long-term storage fees
- **Cube:** Airbeds with built-in pumps = medium cube, manageable but not ideal
  - Queen models with pump = 0.036-0.05 CBM per unit = storage fees add up if slow turn

**OPPORTUNITIES:**
- Coleman brand recognition = higher conversion vs generic
- License ownership = control over pricing, MAP enforcement, exclusive positioning
- Domestic inventory = can serve small retailers who can't order containers (Todd mentioned this)

**VALIDATION REQUIRED (Phase 0):**
1. Amazon.com search: Do these Coleman SKUs exist? Who owns buy box? (Amazon Retail vs 3P sellers)
2. Amazon.ca search: Is Coleman already present? What's pricing/competition?
3. Helium 10 / Jungle Scout: What's monthly search volume for "Coleman airbed Canada"?
4. Margin calc: What's true net margin after FBA fees, storage (assume 90-day turn), PPC (15%), returns (7%)?
5. PLI insurance quote: Airbeds = suffocation risk (rare but exists) — get quote before ordering
6. MAP policy: Does Coleman license require MAP enforcement? Can we control price or will resellers undercut?

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **HOLD on airbeds until Amazon Retail risk validated**
- If Amazon Retail NOT active on .ca and margins hold >25% after all costs: GO on small test quantities (1-2 cartons each SKU max)
- If Amazon Retail IS active or margins <20%: KILL and allocate capital elsewhere

---

### 2. **Trampolines** (HIGH RISK — Insurance & Liability)

**SKUs in Order:**
- 59100: WonderJump 36"x37.5" Trampoline - Qty: 48 units (2 cartons)
- 59124: Aerobounce Exercise Trampoline 40"x53" - Qty: 48 units (2 cartons)

**CRITICAL RED FLAGS:**
- **PLI Insurance:** Trampolines = highest liability risk in the order
  - Injury claims (falls, sprains, fractures)
  - Todd already mentioned "high insurance costs" burned him before
  - **ACTION:** Get PLI quote BEFORE ordering — this alone could kill the SKU
- **Returns/Damage:** Heavy steel frame products = shipping damage, customer assembly issues, high return rate
- **Cube:** Medium cube (0.077-0.091 CBM per unit) but heavy (14-21 kg per carton)
  - FBA fees for oversized = premium pricing
- **Seasonality:** Trampolines = spring/summer outdoor fitness trend
  - Risk: Unsold units Sept-Feb = long-term storage fees
- **Competition:** Fitness trampolines saturated on Amazon (Stamina, JumpSport, MaXimus, Bungee cords vs springs)

**OPPORTUNITIES:**
- Mini trampolines trending (rebounding fitness, TikTok home workouts)
- 2026 NEW for Aerobounce = potential first-mover if trend is fresh
- Corrosion-resistant steel = outdoor use = extends season beyond indoor fitness

**VALIDATION REQUIRED (Phase 0):**
1. **PLI Insurance Quote:** Get hard number for trampolines — if >$500/year per SKU, margin is killed
2. Amazon.ca search: Competition analysis (price points, review counts, BSR)
3. Seasonal demand curve: Google Trends for "mini trampoline Canada" — confirm spring spike
4. Margin calc: FBA fees for oversized items can spike — verify dimensional weight pricing

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **HOLD until PLI quote received**
- If insurance cost >$300/year per SKU: **KILL**
- If insurance manageable and margin >25%: GO on 1 carton (24 units) as test — do NOT order 48 units before validating demand

---

### 3. **TPU Sleeping Pads** (MEDIUM-LOW RISK — Good Opportunity)

**SKUs in Order (Partial List):**
- 69615: WanderLite Regular Rectangular Sleeping Pad - Qty: 24 units
- 69616: WanderLite Large Rectangular Sleeping Pad - Qty: 24 units
- 69643: RidgeLite Insulated Mummy Sleeping Pad - Qty: 24 units
- 69612: AlpineLite Insulated Mummy Sleeping Pad - Qty: 24 units
- 69620: TerrainLite Self-Inflating Mummy Sleeping Pad - Qty: 24 units
- 69622: ComforTrek Self-Inflating Wide Rectangular Sleeping Pad - Qty: 24 units
- 69617: AdventuRest Insulated Regular Rectangular Sleeping Pad - Qty: 24 units

**POSITIVE SIGNALS:**
- **Low Cube:** Sleeping pads compress into small storage bags (0.019-0.134 CBM per unit) = low FBA storage fees
- **Year-Round Demand:** Camping season peaks May-Sept, but indoor use (guests, van life, emergency prep) = year-round baseline
- **Low Insurance Risk:** Sleeping pads = minimal PLI exposure (no injury risk like trampolines or pools)
- **Outdoor/Camping Trend:** Van life, overlanding, festival camping = growing category
- **TPU Material:** Premium vs PVC inflatables = less toxic, more durable, better reviews
- **Duty-Free or Low Duty:** Many camping products = 0% duty (verify HS codes)

**MODERATE RISKS:**
- **Competition:** Therm-a-Rest, Sea to Summit, Klymit dominate high-end; Chinese generics dominate budget
  - Bestway = mid-tier brand, needs to compete on price AND quality
- **New Generation (2025ss/2026):** Many marked "New Generation" or "2026 NEW" = no sales rank data
  - Risk: Untested demand = inventory sits if market doesn't respond
- **Self-Inflating vs Manual:** Self-inflating pads = foam core = bulkier and heavier = higher shipping/storage
  - Manual inflate pads = lighter, smaller, but require pump (inconvenience factor)

**OPPORTUNITIES:**
- **Bundle Strategy:** Sell sleeping pads + pillows + pump sacks as "camping kits" (higher AOV, better margins)
- **Cross-Sell:** Sleeping pads pair with airbeds for indoor guests (upsell opportunity)
- **Niche Targeting:** Mummy pads = backpackers, rectangular = car campers, queen size = couples/families

**VALIDATION REQUIRED (Phase 0):**
1. Amazon.ca search: What's BSR for "camping sleeping pad" top sellers? Who dominates?
2. Keyword research: Search volume for "TPU sleeping pad Canada" vs "self-inflating sleeping pad"
3. Review competitive pricing: Therm-a-Rest = $100-200, Sea to Summit = $80-150, Chinese = $30-60
   - Where does Bestway price competitively? (Likely $40-80 range)
4. Margin calc: Verify FBA fees for small-package sleeping pads (should be favorable)

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **GO on sleeping pads** — this is one of the safer categories in the order
- Prioritize WanderLite and AdventuRest (rectangular, wider appeal) over niche mummy pads
- Start with 12-24 units per SKU (test quantities) before scaling
- Kill or postpone self-inflating queen pads (69662) = bulky, untested, low velocity potential

---

### 4. **Pet Products** (MEDIUM RISK — Growing Category)

**SKUs in Order:**
- 52729: Fetchin' Fun Pet Sprinkler (56"x14"x50") - Qty: 6 units
- 43849: Fetchin' Fun Pet Pool Float (61.5"x44") - Qty: 8 units
- 52699: Fetchin' Fun Pet Splash Pad (58") - Qty: 6 units
- 561KM: Fetchin' Fun Pet Play Pool (4'x12") - Qty: 6 units
- 561RG: Fetchin' Fun Pet Play Pool & Elevated Bed (40"x29"x8") - Qty: 8 units

**POSITIVE SIGNALS:**
- **Growing Market:** Pet products = recession-resistant, high emotional spend, loyal customers
- **Less Competitive Than Kids' Pools:** Pet niche = fewer sellers vs general pool toys
- **Cross-Category Appeal:** Pet owners search "dog pool" not "inflatable pool" = different keyword universe
- **Low Seasonality Risk:** Dogs need cooling solutions May-Sept, but elevated bed (561RG) = year-round use
- **Brand Cohesion:** "Fetchin' Fun" sub-brand = consistent branding across pet line

**MODERATE RISKS:**
- **PLI Exposure:** Pet pools/sprinklers = potential drowning risk (unlikely but exists)
  - **ACTION:** Verify PLI quote includes pet products or if separate rider needed
- **Cube:** Pet pools (561KM, 561RG) = high cube (0.109-0.115 CBM per unit) + heavy (21-23 kg per carton)
  - FBA fees will be high; storage fees add up if slow turn
- **Seasonal Spike:** Pet water products = summer-heavy (June-Aug peak)
  - Risk: Unsold units Sept-Feb = storage fees eat margin
- **Durability Concerns:** Dogs = claws, teeth, rough play = higher return/damage rate than human pool products
  - Need to factor 5-10% return/damage allowance

**OPPORTUNITIES:**
- **TikTok Viral Potential:** Dog content = always trending (cute dogs in pools = shareable)
- **Bundle Potential:** Pet pool + splash pad + sprinkler = "Ultimate Dog Summer Kit"
- **Elevated Bed (561RG) = Dual-Use:** Pool in summer, elevated bed year-round = extends sales window
- **Domestic Inventory Advantage:** Pet owners = impulse buyers, 2-day Prime delivery beats Chewy's 5-7 days

**VALIDATION REQUIRED (Phase 0):**
1. Amazon.ca search: "dog pool" BSR and competition (likely less saturated than kids' pools)
2. Review analysis: What are common complaints? (Durability, leaks, size accuracy)
3. PLI insurance: Confirm pet products covered under standard policy or need endorsement
4. Margin calc: FBA fees for oversized pet pools (561KM, 561RG) = verify profitability
5. Seasonality check: Google Trends "dog pool Canada" — confirm summer spike, plan for offseason

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **GO on pet splash pad (52699) and pet pool float (43849)** — lower cube, manageable risk
- **HOLD on large pet pools (561KM, 561RG)** until margin/storage fee validation — high cube = high risk
- Test pet category first with low-cube items; if successful, scale into pools in 2027

---

### 5. **Swim Accessories** (LOW RISK — Strong Opportunity)

**SKUs in Order:**
- 26006: Glider Swim Cap - Qty: 36 units
- 26049: Lil' Color Wave Swim Cap - Qty: 36 units
- 26039: Sleek'N Stretch Premium Fabric Swim Cap - Qty: 24 units
- 26029: Squiggle Wiggle Fish Dive Toys - Qty: 36 units
- 26009: Lil' Fish Dive Toys - Qty: 24 units
- 26031: Speedy Squid Dive Toys - Qty: 36 units
- 26032: Hydroventure Nose Clip & Ear Plugs Set - Qty: 36 units

**POSITIVE SIGNALS:**
- **Ultra-Low Cube:** Swim caps, dive toys, nose clips = tiny packaging (0.006-0.04 CBM per unit)
  - FBA storage fees negligible; can sit in inventory for months without bleeding cash
- **Year-Round Demand:** Indoor pools, swim lessons, competitive swimming = not just summer
  - Swim caps peak Sept-Nov (back-to-school swim teams) AND May-July (summer lessons)
- **Low Insurance Risk:** Swim accessories = zero PLI exposure (no injury or drowning risk)
- **Replenishment Category:** Swim caps tear, ear plugs get lost = repeat purchase behavior
- **Low Competition vs Pool Toys:** "Swim cap Canada" = niche keyword, less saturated than "pool float"
- **0% Duty:** HS Code 6506.91.00.00 (swim caps) and 9506.29.00.00 (dive toys) = duty-free

**MINIMAL RISKS:**
- **Low AOV:** Swim caps = $8-15 retail, dive toys = $10-20 retail
  - Risk: Low basket size unless bundled or multi-pack
- **Brand Perception:** Bestway = known for inflatables, not swim gear
  - May need stronger imagery/copy to compete with Speedo, TYR, Arena in swim caps

**OPPORTUNITIES:**
- **Bundle Strategy:** "Swim Starter Kit" = cap + goggles + nose clip + dive toys = $40-50 AOV
- **Multi-Pack:** Sell swim caps in 3-packs (family pack) to increase AOV
- **SEO Play:** Target long-tail keywords ("kids swim cap Canada," "silicone swim cap non-latex")
- **Low-Risk Test SKUs:** Perfect for first launch wave — low capital, low cube, low downside

**VALIDATION REQUIRED (Phase 0):**
1. Amazon.ca search: Swim cap competition and pricing (likely $10-20 range)
2. Keyword volume: "swim cap," "dive toys," "ear plugs swimming" — verify search demand
3. Margin calc: Even with low retail price, low FBA fees + 0% duty = should yield 30%+ margin

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **GO on all swim accessories** — this is the safest category in the order
- Prioritize swim caps (26006, 26049) and dive toys (26029, 26031) for first launch wave
- Use swim accessories as "learning SKUs" to train Todd's team on listing optimization and PPC without high risk

### 6. **Beach Balls & Play Products** (LOW-MEDIUM RISK)

**SKUs in Order:**
- 31021: 20"/51cm Summer Essential Small Beach Ball - Qty: 36 units
- 31022: 24"/61cm Summer Essential Large Beach Ball - Qty: 36 units
- 31036: 20"/51cm Groove 'n Splash Beach Ball - Qty: 36 units
- 31152: 42"/1.07m Colorsphere Beach Ball - Qty: 24 units
- 52648: 2.3"/5.85cm Splash & Play 100 Play Balls - Qty: 204 units
- 52649: 2.3"/5.85cm Splash & Play 250 Play Balls - Qty: 120 units

**POSITIVE SIGNALS:**
- **Low Cube:** Beach balls deflate to near-zero cube; play balls = small packaging (0.013-0.115 CBM per unit)
- **Low Insurance Risk:** Beach balls = minimal PLI (not a choking hazard for target age)
- **Year-Round for Play Balls:** Ball pits = indoor play, daycare, therapy = not just summer
- **Impulse Buy:** Beach balls = $5-15 retail = low decision friction, high add-to-cart rate
- **Replenishment:** Beach balls get lost, damaged, deflated = repeat purchase

**MODERATE RISKS:**
- **High Competition:** Beach balls = commodity product, dozens of sellers
  - Risk: Price compression, low differentiation
- **Seasonal (Beach Balls):** May-Aug peak, Sept-April dead zone
  - Risk: Unsold beach balls Sept-Feb = storage fees (minimal due to low cube, but still a factor)
- **Play Balls = Saturation:** Ball pit balls = Amazon flooded with 50-500 packs
  - Need to compete on price, quality (non-toxic PE), and Prime delivery

**OPPORTUNITIES:**
- **Branded Packaging:** "Groove 'n Splash" graphics = differentiation vs generic beach balls
- **Multi-Pack Strategy:** Sell beach balls in 3-packs or 6-packs for higher AOV
- **Cross-Sell with Pools:** Beach balls + pool floats = bundle upsell
- **Play Balls = Daycare B2B:** Market to daycares, therapy centers, trampoline parks (bulk orders)

**VALIDATION REQUIRED (Phase 0):**
1. Amazon.ca search: Beach ball BSR and pricing (likely $8-15 for 20-24" balls)
2. Play ball competition: 100-pack vs 250-pack pricing and review quality
3. Margin calc: Beach balls = low retail price, but ultra-low FBA fees = verify 25%+ margin holds

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **GO on beach balls (31021, 31022, 31036)** — low risk, good for summer launch
- **HOLD on 42" Colorsphere (31152)** — large size = higher cube, lower velocity, test smaller balls first
- **GO on play balls (52648, 52649)** — year-round demand, low cube, replenishment category

---

### 7. **Pool Lounges & Floats** (HIGH RISK — Cube + Seasonality)

**SKUs in Order:**
- 43909: Everluxe Hammock Lounge 48"x25"x6" - Qty: 12 units
- 43838: Sun-Kissed Tanning Lounge 7'x61" - Qty: 6 units
- 43913: Everluxe Floating Mat 72"x35"x8" - Qty: 12 units
- 43734: Splashin' Style Fabric Noodle 60"x6"x6" - Qty: 12 units

**CRITICAL RED FLAGS:**
- **High Cube:** Pool lounges and floating mats = bulky even when deflated (0.037-0.802 CBM per unit)
  - Floating Mat (43913) = 0.802 CBM per unit = HIGHEST cube in entire order
  - Storage fees will crush margin if these don't sell in 60-90 days
- **Extreme Seasonality:** Pool floats = 90% of sales May-Aug
  - Risk: Goods arrive end of April, if they don't sell by end of August, you're sitting on inventory until May 2027
  - Long-term storage fees kick in after 365 days = margin death spiral
- **High Competition:** Pool floats = saturated category (Intex, Kelsyus, SwimWays, plus 100+ Chinese brands)
- **7% Duty:** HS Code 3926.90.99.90 = 7% duty (Everluxe items) = margin hit

**MODERATE OPPORTUNITIES:**
- **Premium Positioning:** "Everluxe" sub-brand = premium fabric, UV protection, quick-dry
  - Can command $30-50 retail vs $15-25 generic floats
- **4-in-1 Hammock Lounge (43909):** Convertible structure = marketing angle ("4 floats in 1")
- **Fabric Noodle (43734):** Removable, machine-washable cover = premium vs foam noodles
  - Lower cube than lounges (0.028 CBM) = more manageable

**VALIDATION REQUIRED (Phase 0):**
1. Amazon.ca search: Premium pool float pricing and BSR
   - Intex basic lounges = $15-25; premium fabric floats = $35-60 range
2. Cube-to-margin ratio: Calculate storage fees if unsold Aug-Dec
   - Example: Floating Mat 0.802 CBM = ~$15-20 in storage fees Oct-April if it sits
   - If retail is $60 and margin is $15, storage fees eat 100% of margin
3. Seasonal velocity: Can you realistically sell 12 Everluxe Floating Mats in 90 days (May-Aug)?
   - If not, don't order 12 — order 3-6 max as test

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **KILL Everluxe Floating Mat (43913)** — cube is prohibitive, 12 units = too much risk for unproven SKU
- **HOLD Sun-Kissed Tanning Lounge (43838)** — 6 units manageable IF margin holds >30% and you commit to aggressive May-June PPC push
- **HOLD Everluxe Hammock Lounge (43909)** — 4-in-1 feature = differentiation, but 12 units = risky; reduce to 6 units max
- **GO on Fabric Noodle (43734)** — lower cube, niche product (premium vs foam), 12 units = reasonable test

---

### 8. **Bop Bags / Indoor Toys** (LOW-MEDIUM RISK)

**SKUs in Order:**
- 52152: 35"/89cm Animal Bop Bags - Qty: 48 units
- 52630: 47"/1.19m Comic Blast Bop Bag - Qty: 48 units
- 52545: 47"/1.20m Monster Knockout Bop Bag (w/ gloves) - Qty: 12 units

**POSITIVE SIGNALS:**
- **Year-Round Demand:** Indoor toys = not seasonal (rainy day play, basement toys)
- **Low Cube:** Bop bags deflate to small packages (0.027-0.042 CBM per unit)
- **Low Insurance Risk:** Bop bags = minimal PLI (built-in water chamber = stable, low tip risk)
- **Developmental Angle:** Gross motor skills, confidence, active play = parent appeal
- **Low Competition vs Pool Toys:** "Bop bag" niche = fewer sellers than pool floats

**MODERATE RISKS:**
- **Niche Product:** Bop bags = not as mainstream as beach balls or swim toys
  - Risk: Lower search volume = slower velocity
- **Seasonality (Minor):** Slight uptick in sales Nov-Dec (holiday gifts), Jan-Feb (indoor winter play)
  - But overall steady year-round
- **Durability Concerns:** PVC inflatable + repeated punching = potential leaks/returns
  - Factor 3-5% return/damage rate

**OPPORTUNITIES:**
- **TikTok/Reel Content:** Kids punching bop bags = shareable content (comedic, cute)
- **Gifting:** Bop bags = birthday party gifts, stocking stuffers
- **Bundle with Ball Pits:** "Indoor Active Play Set" = bop bag + play balls

**VALIDATION REQUIRED (Phase 0):**
1. Amazon.ca search: "Bop bag" BSR and competition
2. Keyword volume: "Inflatable punching bag kids" vs "bop bag"
3. Review analysis: Durability complaints? Leak issues?

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **GO on Animal Bop Bags (52152)** — 48 units manageable, cute graphics appeal to younger kids
- **HOLD on Comic Blast (52630)** — 48 units = aggressive for unproven SKU; reduce to 24 units
- **GO on Monster Knockout (52545)** — includes gloves = higher AOV ($25-35 retail), 12 units = safe test quantity

---

### 9. **Pool Accessories** (MEDIUM RISK — Niche but Useful)

**SKUs in Order:**
- 58498: 6056L/1600gal Sand Filter - Qty: 24 units
- 58475: Polysphere Pool Filtration Balls - Qty: 360 units
- 58948-58953: Premium Pool Covers (10', 12', 15', 16', 18' round) - Qty: 24 each
- 58111: SolarFloat LED Pool Light - Qty: 24 units
- 58419: FloatBright LED Pool Light - Qty: 12 units

**POSITIVE SIGNALS:**
- **Consumable/Replenishment:** Filtration balls, pool covers = replace annually
- **Year-Round (Pool Covers):** Covers needed Sept-May to winterize pools
  - Counter-seasonal to pool toys = helps smooth revenue curve
- **High AOV:** Sand filter = $100-150 retail, pool covers = $40-80 retail
  - Better margins vs $10 beach balls
- **Low Competition in Niche:** "Polysphere filtration balls" = newer product, less saturated than sand

**MODERATE RISKS:**
- **Compatibility Issues:** Sand filter (58498) = "compatible with 1,100-42,300 L pools"
  - Risk: Customer buys wrong size, returns due to incompatibility
  - Need strong listing copy + comparison chart
- **Pool Covers = Size-Specific:** 5 different SKUs (10', 12', 15', 16', 18')
  - Risk: Inventory fragmentation (one size sells out, others sit)
  - 24 units per size = 120 total units pool covers = capital tied up
- **Seasonality (Filter/Lights):** Pool accessories = May-Aug peak, but covers = Sept-Nov peak
  - Decent seasonal spread

**OPPORTUNITIES:**
- **Bundle Strategy:** Sand filter + filtration balls = "Complete Filtration System"
- **Pool Cover = Winterization Keyword:** Target "pool winterizing Canada" Sept-Oct
- **LED Lights = Ambience Trend:** Backyard pool parties, Instagram-worthy lighting

**VALIDATION REQUIRED (Phase 0):**
1. Amazon.ca search: Sand filter competition (Intex, Bestway, Hayward) — pricing and BSR
2. Polysphere filtration balls: Is this established or niche? Review volume and sentiment
3. Pool cover sizing: Which sizes sell fastest? (likely 12' and 15' most common)
   - Consider killing 10', 16', 18' and doubling up on 12' and 15'

**RECOMMENDATION:**
- **HOLD on sand filter (58498)** — 24 units = high capital ($2,400-3,000), validate demand first
- **GO on Polysphere filtration balls (58475)** — 360 units = small, lightweight, replenishment item, low risk
- **HOLD on pool covers** — reduce from 24 units per size to 12 units per size, focus on 12' and 15' only
- **GO on LED pool lights (58111, 58419)** — novelty item, low cube, decent margin, summer ambience trend

## Summary Scorecard — Quick Triage

| Category | Risk Level | Recommendation | Action Before Order Lock |
|----------|-----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **Coleman Airbeds** | 🔴 HIGH | HOLD | Amazon Retail check, margin calc, PLI quote |
| **Trampolines** | 🔴 HIGH | HOLD | PLI insurance quote CRITICAL |
| **TPU Sleeping Pads** | 🟡 MEDIUM-LOW | GO | Reduce quantities on self-inflating queen pads |
| **Pet Products** | 🟡 MEDIUM | GO (selective) | Focus on low-cube items (splash pad, float); pause large pools |
| **Swim Accessories** | 🟢 LOW | GO | Perfect for first launch wave, low risk |
| **Beach Balls / Play Balls** | 🟡 MEDIUM-LOW | GO | Skip 42" beach ball, focus on 20-24" |
| **Pool Lounges / Floats** | 🔴 HIGH | KILL/HOLD | Kill Everluxe Floating Mat, reduce lounges to 6 units max |
| **Bop Bags / Indoor Toys** | 🟡 MEDIUM-LOW | GO | Reduce Comic Blast to 24 units |
| **Pool Accessories** | 🟡 MEDIUM | HOLD (selective) | Reduce pool cover SKUs, validate sand filter demand |

## Capital Reallocation Suggestion

**If you follow the KILL/HOLD recommendations above, you'll free up ~$10K-15K in capital.**

**Reallocate that capital to:**
1. **Double down on swim accessories** (caps, dive toys, nose clips) — proven low-risk, year-round
2. **Increase sleeping pad quantities** on proven SKUs (WanderLite, AdventuRest) — test with 36-48 units instead of 24
3. **Add Bestway items NOT in current order:**
   - Pool maintenance chemicals (if available) = high margin, repeat purchase
   - Repair kits, patch kits = low cube, impulse add-on item
   - Air pumps (manual, rechargeable) = year-round, cross-sell with airbeds and inflatables
4. **Reserve $5K for PPC launch budget** — better to have fewer SKUs with strong PPC support than many SKUs with no budget left

## Next Steps for Greg → Todd

### **Immediate (Before Next Call):**
1. **Amazon.com Competitive Audit:** Search all Coleman airbed SKUs (90708, 90709, 90710, 90711, 90703, 90704)
   - Who owns buy box? (Amazon Retail vs 3P)
   - What's pricing? (If Amazon is $49.99 and Todd's landed cost forces $59.99 retail, he loses)
   - Review counts and sentiment?

2. **PLI Insurance Research:** Contact Todd's insurance broker
   - Get quote for trampolines (59100, 59124) — separate quote if possible
   - Confirm pool products (pet pools, lounges, floats) covered under standard PLI or need endorsement
   - If trampoline insurance >$500/year total, recommend killing those SKUs

3. **FBA Fee Calculator:** Run top 10 SKUs through Amazon FBA fee calculator
   - Focus on high-cube items (pool lounges, floating mat, pet pools, trampolines)
   - Calculate storage fees if unsold for 90 days, 180 days, 365 days
   - Flag any SKUs where storage fees exceed 10% of projected margin

### **On Next Call with Todd:**
1. **Present Risk Tiers:** Show the scorecard above (RED/YELLOW/GREEN)
2. **Anchor to Phase 0 Value:** "Before you lock this order, let's kill the 15-20 SKUs that will bleed money. That could save you $10K-15K in dead inventory."
3. **Propose Revised Order:** Based on validation, give Todd a revised container plan:
   - KILL: 10-15 SKUs (high cube, high risk, unproven)
   - HOLD: 10-15 SKUs (reduce quantities pending validation)
   - GO: 20-25 SKUs (low risk, proven, or strategic test)
4. **Set Expectations:** "Phase 0 will take 1-2 weeks. That still gives you time to lock the order by early January for March 10 ship date."

## Final Thought for Greg

**Todd is about to repeat the same mistake he made before: ordering too much of the wrong products.**

His draft order has:
- High cube (pool lounges, floating mats)
- High seasonality (90% summer products)
- High insurance risk (trampolines, pet pools)
- High Amazon Retail risk (Coleman airbeds)
- Too many unproven 2026 NEW SKUs with no sales data

**Your value in Phase 0 is to stop him from making a $50K mistake.**

If you can cut 30% of this order and reallocate to safer SKUs, you'll save him $15K-20K in the next 12 months.

That's the pitch: **"I'll pay for myself 3-5x in Phase 0 alone by preventing bad product decisions."**

Lead with that.
