# FINAL SUMMARY — Complete Action Plan for Todd

**Date:** December 13, 2025
**Status:** Ready to send email and prepare for call
**Key Updates:** Realistic pricing ($225/hour), EcomExperts positioning, reality check on expectations

---

## 🎯 **THE SITUATION (Your Reality Check)**

### **What Greg Knows:**
1. **Todd is talking to EcomExperts** (US consultant, monthly fee model)
2. **Amazon.ca is 10x smaller than US market** (lower volume, slower path to profitability)
3. **Product validation ≠ guaranteed success** (depends on PPC budget, execution, timing, market conditions)
4. **First order almost always loses money** (break-even on first order = win)
5. **Todd might be looking for a "magic bullet"** (unrealistic expectations = red flag)

### **Greg's Concerns:**
- "I don't want to over-promise and under-deliver"
- "Success depends on many variables I can't control (PPC budget, creative quality, execution)"
- "If Todd has unrealistic expectations (profit in 90 days, $500/month PPC budget), I'll be blamed when it doesn't work"
- "I need to qualify Todd BEFORE committing to Phase 0"

### **Greg's Goal:**
- Qualify Todd as a client (realistic expectations, adequate budget, strong execution capability)
- Set expectations upfront (validation reduces risk, doesn't guarantee success)
- Protect reputation (don't take money from wrong client)
- Complement EcomExperts (don't compete)

## 📁 **COMPLETE DOCUMENT PACKAGE (8 Files)**

### **🔴 PRIORITY 1: Read These First**

**1. [REALITY_CHECK_Expectations.md](REALITY_CHECK_Expectations.md)** ⚠️ **READ THIS FIRST**

## ✅ **YOUR ACTION PLAN (Step-by-Step)**

### **STEP 1: Send the Email (TODAY — Dec 13)**

**Send:** [EMAIL_With_EcomExperts_Positioning.md](EMAIL_With_EcomExperts_Positioning.md)

**Key points:**
- Phase 0: $225/hour, 35-45 hours, $10,500 cap
- Positions you as complementary to EcomExperts (validate before execute)
- Emphasizes Canada expertise
- Proposes call next week

---

### **STEP 2: Prepare for the Call (This Weekend)**

**Read in this order:**
1. **[REALITY_CHECK_Expectations.md](REALITY_CHECK_Expectations.md)** — Memorize the 6 qualifying questions
2. **[ACTION_GUIDE_EcomExperts.md](ACTION_GUIDE_EcomExperts.md)** — Your call playbook
3. **[NURISE_Product_Analysis_RedFlags.md](NURISE_Product_Analysis_RedFlags.md)** — Specific SKU insights for reference

- Run high-cube items through FBA fee calculator
- Review top 5 red flags and top 3 opportunities

---

### **STEP 3: The Call (Next Week — Dec 17-19)**

**Call Structure (60 minutes):**

**Part 1: QUALIFY TODD FIRST (15-20 minutes)**

**Ask the 6 qualifying questions (BEFORE you pitch anything):**
1. "What does success look like for you in 12 months?"
2. "What's your PPC budget for the first 6 months?"
3. "What happened with your last Amazon attempt? Why did you lose money?"
4. "Do you have budget for professional photography and A+ Content?"
5. "How much time can your internal team member dedicate to Amazon daily?"
6. "What's your timeline expectation for profitability?"

**Listen for red flags:**
- Unrealistic expectations (profit in 90 days)
- Low PPC budget ($500/month or less)
- No ownership of past mistakes (blames external factors only)
- No budget for creative (wants to use factory photos)
- No time commitment (team member only has "a few hours a week")
- Impossible timeline (need results in 3 months or project gets killed)

**⚠️ IF 2+ RED FLAGS: Use the "Walk Away" script from REALITY_CHECK_Expectations.md**

**If Todd's answers are GOOD → Proceed to Part 2**

---

**Part 2: UNDERSTAND ECOMEXPERTS (10 minutes)**

**Ask about EcomExperts:**
1. "What does EcomExperts' proposal include?"
2. "What's their monthly fee and contract length?"
3. "Are they Canada-focused or US-focused?"
4. "How do you see me fitting in with EcomExperts?"

**Listen for:**
- Do they do validation or just execution?
- What's the monthly cost? ($2K? $3K? $5K?)
- Does Todd want to choose (you OR EcomExperts) or use both?

**If Todd wants to use BOTH → Position as complementary (you validate, they execute)**

---

**Part 3: SET EXPECTATIONS (10-15 minutes)**

**Use the expectation-setting script from REALITY_CHECK_Expectations.md:**

"Todd, I want to be transparent about what Phase 0 can and can't do.

**What I CAN do:**
- Validate product selection, identify low-risk SKUs, eliminate high-risk SKUs
- Build margin models so you know profitability potential IF all other factors align

**What I CANNOT do:**
- Guarantee sales volume (market demand outside my control)
- Guarantee Amazon Retail won't list your products tomorrow
- Guarantee your PPC budget will be adequate (assumes $1,500-3,000/month minimum)
- Guarantee execution quality (poor creative or weak PPC management kills good products)
- Make Amazon.ca bigger than it is (10x smaller than US market)

**Think of Phase 0 as risk reduction, not a crystal ball.**

I can prevent you from ordering $15K-20K of bad products. That's value.

But I can't guarantee the remaining products will be home runs. That depends on PPC budget, creative quality, timing, execution, and market conditions.

**Also: Amazon is a 12-18 month play.** First container is almost always an investment (break-even or small loss). Second container is where profit starts.

**Does that align with your expectations?"**

**If Todd says "Yes, I understand" → Proceed to Part 4**
**If Todd pushes back → Red flag, consider walking away**

---

**Part 4: POSITION PHASE 0 (10-15 minutes)**

**Now that Todd is qualified and expectations are set, pitch Phase 0:**

"Great. Here's how I'd structure Phase 0:

**Product Validation & Risk Assessment:**
- Validate all 50+ SKUs for Canadian market
- GO/HOLD/KILL recommendations based on data
- Margin models with all Canadian costs (FBA.ca, GST/HST, PPC, insurance, storage)
- Competitive research (Amazon.com + .ca, Amazon Retail threat assessment)
- Revised container plan (kill bad SKUs, reallocate capital to winners)

**Pricing:**
- $225/hour, estimated 35-45 hours
- Hard cap: $10,500 (you won't pay more than this)
- Weekly time tracking (full transparency)
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks (complete by early Jan before you lock order)

**Then you decide:**
- Take GO list and hand to EcomExperts for execution
- Continue with me for setup + training (Phase 1-2)
- Use both (me for Canada strategy, EcomExperts for execution)

**Does that make sense?"**

---

**Part 5: WALK THROUGH RED FLAGS (10 minutes)**

**Show Todd the top 5 red flags in his draft order:**
1. Coleman airbeds = Amazon Retail threat
2. Trampolines = insurance costs unknown
3. Everluxe Floating Mat = 0.802 CBM = storage fee death
4. 90% summer products = seasonal concentration
5. 2026 NEW SKUs = no sales data = inventory risk

**Use specific examples from NURISE_Product_Analysis_RedFlags.md**

---

**Part 6: CLOSE (5 minutes)**

"Todd, Phase 0 is a $10,500 investment that prevents a $50K mistake.

**If we identify and kill $15K-20K of bad SKUs before you order them, Phase 0 pays for itself.**

**Then you have validated products to launch** (whether with EcomExperts, your internal team, or continued support from me).

**Does that make sense? Ready to move forward?"**

---

### **STEP 4: After the Call (Next Steps)**

**If Todd says YES:**
- Send engagement letter (1-page SOW: scope, deliverables, $225/hour, $10,500 cap)
- Request 50% deposit ($5,250) or set up weekly invoicing
- Schedule kickoff call for Dec 18-20
- Start Phase 0

**If Todd says "Let me think about it":**
- Send follow-up email summarizing call
- Reiterate timeline urgency (need to start by Dec 20 to finish by Jan 3)
- Offer to answer questions
- Set follow-up date (Dec 18-19)

**If Todd exhibits 2+ red flags:**
- Use "Walk Away" script from REALITY_CHECK_Expectations.md
- Be professional but firm
- Protect your reputation (don't take money from wrong client)

---

## 🔑 **KEY TALKING POINTS (Memorize These)**

### **1. Qualifying Todd (First Thing on Call)**
"Before we dive into Phase 0, I want to make sure we're aligned on expectations. What does success look like for you in 12 months?"

### **2. Setting Expectations (After Qualifying)**
"I want to be transparent: Phase 0 is risk reduction, not a magic wand. I can prevent you from ordering bad products, but I can't guarantee sales volume. That depends on PPC budget, execution, timing, and market conditions. Does that make sense?"

### **3. Positioning vs EcomExperts (After Expectations)**
"EcomExperts is great for execution. I complement them by doing upfront validation with a Canada-specific lens. Phase 0 with me happens BEFORE EcomExperts. I validate the products, you get a GO/HOLD/KILL list, then EcomExperts takes that and executes."

### **4. Pricing (After Positioning)**
"Phase 0 is $225/hour, estimated 35-45 hours, hard cap at $10,500. You get full transparency (weekly time tracking) and cost certainty (cap protects you from overruns). If we kill $15K-20K of bad SKUs, Phase 0 pays for itself."

### **5. Closing (End of Call)**
"Phase 0 prevents the $50K mistake. Even if you use EcomExperts after, you're starting with validated products — not guesses. Does that make sense? Ready to move forward?"

## ⚠️ **RED FLAGS (When to Walk Away)**

**IF 2+ OF THESE, CONSIDER WALKING AWAY:**

1. ❌ **Unrealistic expectations:** "We need profit in 90 days"
2. ❌ **Low PPC budget:** "$500/month is all we have"
3. ❌ **No ownership of past mistakes:** "Last time we lost money because Amazon changed the algorithm"
4. ❌ **No budget for creative:** "Can we just use factory photos?"
5. ❌ **No time commitment:** "Our team member has a few hours a week"
6. ❌ **Looking for magic bullet:** "Just tell us which products to order and we'll be fine"

**Use "Walk Away" script from REALITY_CHECK_Expectations.md**

"Todd, based on our conversation, I'm concerned our expectations might not be aligned. Amazon.ca requires patience, capital, and strong execution. If those constraints are non-negotiable, Amazon might not be the right channel right now. I don't want to take your money and set you up for failure."
