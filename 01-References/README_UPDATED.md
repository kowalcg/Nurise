---

## 🚨 Key Talking Points (UPDATED)

### **The Reality:**
"Todd, based on the number of SKUs in your draft order (50+) and the depth of research required, a thorough validation will take 35-45 hours. Some SKUs are quick to assess (swim caps = low risk). Others require significant research (Coleman airbeds = Amazon.com competitive check, margin modeling, insurance quotes for trampolines)."

### **The Pricing:**
"I recommend an hourly approach with a hard cap: $225/hour, estimated 35-45 hours, capped at $10,500. This gives you full transparency (weekly time tracking) and cost certainty (cap protects you from overruns)."

### **The Value:**
"If Phase 0 prevents you from ordering even $15K worth of bad SKUs (high-cube floats, seasonal products, Amazon Retail threats), you get a 1.5x return on investment in year one. That's conservative."

### **The Alternative:**
"If $10,500 is outside your budget, we can reduce scope: Top 20 SKUs for $5,500 gives you the core risk assessment on your highest-priority products. If you like the results, we can validate the remaining SKUs separately."

---

## 🚨 Top 5 Red Flags (Quick Reference)

1. **Coleman Airbeds** = Amazon Retail will own the buy box (check Amazon.com NOW)
2. **Trampolines** = Insurance costs unknown (get PLI quote BEFORE ordering)
3. **Everluxe Floating Mat** = 0.802 CBM = storage fee death if unsold Aug-Feb
4. **90% Summer Products** = Seasonal concentration (dead inventory risk Sep-Feb)
5. **2026 NEW SKUs** = No sales data = inventory risk (order test quantities only)

---

## ✅ Top 3 Opportunities (Build Confidence)

1. **Swim Accessories** = Low cube, year-round, 0% duty, zero PLI, perfect first launch
2. **TPU Sleeping Pads** = Growing outdoor category, less competitive, low cube
3. **Pet Products** = Niche, loyal buyers, TikTok viral potential, less saturated

---

## 🔒 Protect Your Time (Scope Boundaries)

### **Phase 0 INCLUDES:**
- Scorecard analysis (all SKUs or top 20-30, depending on scope)
- Competitive research (Amazon.com + .ca, keyword volume, BSR)
- Margin modeling (FBA fees, storage, PPC estimates, insurance coordination)
- GO/HOLD/KILL recommendations with reasoning
- Email/Slack support during engagement
- 2 calls (kickoff + review)
- Weekly time tracking reports

### **Phase 0 does NOT include:**
- Creating listing copy or product descriptions (that's Phase 1)
- Creating product images or A+ Content (client provides or hires separately)
- Setting up PPC campaigns (that's Phase 2)
- Managing Todd's account day-to-day (unless separate retainer)
- Researching NEW SKUs not in the draft order (out of scope)
- Training Todd's team (that's Phase 2)
- Ongoing support after delivery (unless separate retainer)

**If Todd asks for scope additions:** "That's outside Phase 0 scope. We can add it for $X additional hours, or tackle it in Phase 1/2."

## 💡 Final Thought

**You were right to push back on the original $4,500 pricing.**

11 years of Amazon experience is worth $225-250/hour. Phase 0 done properly takes 35-45 hours, not 18-20.

**Don't undervalue your expertise.**

If Todd can't afford $10,500, reduce scope (top 20 SKUs for $5,500). If he won't pay your rate, he's not the right client.

**You're not selling hours. You're selling risk reduction.**

Phase 0 prevents a $50K mistake. That's the value proposition.

**Stick to your pricing. You're worth it.**
