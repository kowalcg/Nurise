## Objective

The goal of this SOP is to guide new Amazon sellers through managing cash flow and analyzing profitability for their first three orders. This will ensure they maintain financial stability and maximize profits as they establish their product in the market.

## Initial Order Planning

1. **Identify Product Cost:** Calculate the total cost of producing the product, including materials, labor, and overhead.
2. **Shipping Costs:** Determine the shipping costs for the initial order. Consider different shipping methods (air vs. sea) and their impacts on cost and lead time.
3. **Amazon Fees:** Estimate Amazon fees, including FBA fees, referral fees, and any other applicable charges.
4. **Advertising Budget:** Set aside a budget for initial advertising to boost product visibility and sales.

## Place the First Order

1. **Order Quantity:** Start with a manageable quantity, typically enough for 30-90 days of inventory based on forecasted sales.
2. **Payment Terms:** Negotiate favorable payment terms with your supplier (e.g., 30% upfront, 70% on shipment).
3. **Lead Time:** Factor in production and shipping lead times to ensure timely delivery.

## Launch and Marketing

1. **Product Launch:** Once the product is live, implement your advertising strategy. Initially, focus on Pay-Per-Click (PPC) campaigns and promotions.
2. **Pricing Strategy:** Set an introductory price that is competitive to attract initial customers, possibly using coupons or discounts.

## Track Cash Flow for the First Order

1. **Sales Revenue:** Record daily sales revenue from Amazon.
2. **Advertising Spend:** Track daily advertising expenses.
3. **Operating Costs:** Include any other operating costs incurred during the period.
4. **Cash Outflows:** Monitor payments for production, shipping, and Amazon fees.

## Analyze Profitability After the First Order

1. **Gross Margin:** Calculate the gross margin (Sales Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold).
2. **Net Profit:** Subtract all expenses (including advertising and Amazon fees) from the gross margin to find the net profit.
3. **Evaluate Performance:** Compare actual sales and profits against initial projections.

## Second Order Adjustments

1. **Reorder Quantity:** Adjust the reorder quantity based on actual sales data. Aim to cover another 30-60 days of inventory.
2. **Adjust Advertising:** Optimize advertising campaigns based on performance data. Reduce spending on ineffective keywords and increase on high-performing ones.
3. **Raise Price Gradually:** If initial sales and reviews are positive, gradually raise the price to the intended target price.

## Track Cash Flow for the Second Order

1. **Repeat Tracking:** Continue to track sales, advertising spend, operating costs, and cash outflows as done with the first order.
2. **Analyze Improvements:** Assess the impact of any changes made after the first order, such as pricing adjustments and optimized advertising.

## Third Order Strategy

1. **Stabilize Inventory:** Aim for a stable inventory level that minimizes stockouts without overstocking.
2. **Focus on Organic Sales:** As the product gains traction, aim to increase organic sales through improved rankings and customer reviews.
3. **Lower Tacos:** Reduce Total Advertising Cost of Sales (Tacos) as organic sales increase.

## Track Cash Flow for the Third Order

1. **Maintain Records:** Keep detailed records of sales, expenses, and profits.
2. **Evaluate Long-term Viability:** Assess whether the product is achieving sustainable profitability.

## Ongoing Profitability Analysis

1. **Monitor Metrics:** Regularly monitor key financial metrics such as gross margin, net profit, and cash flow.
2. **Continuous Improvement:** Continuously optimize pricing, advertising, and inventory strategies based on performance data.
