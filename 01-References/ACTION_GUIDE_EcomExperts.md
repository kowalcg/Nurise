## 🔑 Your Key Positioning Points

### **1. You Validate, They Execute (Complementary Roles)**

**Say this:**
"EcomExperts is great for ongoing execution — PPC management, listings, account optimization. But before you engage them (or anyone), you need product validation. If you send them a list of 50 SKUs and 30% are bad products, they'll still execute the plan... and you'll lose money.

Phase 0 with me happens BEFORE execution. I validate the products, give you the GO/HOLD/KILL list, then EcomExperts (or your team) takes the validated list and runs with it."

**Frame:** You = strategic validator, EcomExperts = tactical executor

---

### **2. Canada Expertise (Your Differentiator)**

**Say this:**
"EcomExperts likely has strong US Amazon experience. But Amazon.ca has nuances that US consultants often miss:
- GST/HST and provincial sales tax (QST in Quebec)
- FBA.ca fees and storage costs (different from FBA.com)
- Amazon.ca competitive landscape (less saturated, but Amazon Retail behaves differently)
- Canadian pricing strategy (CAD vs USD)

I'm Canada-based with 11 years of Amazon.ca + US experience. I can validate your products specifically for the Canadian market, which complements what a US consultant brings."

**Frame:** Canada specialist (you) + US execution expert (EcomExperts) = best of both

---

### **3. One-Time Project vs Monthly Retainer (Cost Comparison)**

**Say this:**
"Our models are different:
- **EcomExperts:** Monthly retainer (likely $2,500-4,000/month) for ongoing support
- **Greg:** One-time project (Phase 0 = $10,500) for upfront validation

You might need both:
- Me for upfront validation (prevents the $50K mistake)
- EcomExperts for ongoing execution (if you want to outsource PPC and account management)

Or, you might only need me (Phase 0-3 for $25K-30K total), then your internal team runs it.

It depends on whether you want to build internal capability or outsource long-term."

**Frame:** Different models, not apples-to-apples comparison

## ❓ Critical Discovery Questions (Ask on the Call)

**PRIORITY 1: QUALIFY TODD FIRST (Before positioning Phase 0)**

**These qualifying questions determine if Todd is the RIGHT CLIENT. Ask these BEFORE you pitch anything.**

### **Q1: "What does success look like for you in 12 months?"**
- **Good answer:** Break-even or small profit, build brand presence, validate for US expansion
- **Bad answer:** Make investment back in 3-6 months, replace B2B revenue in year 1
- **Red flag:** Unrealistic expectations → You'll be blamed when he doesn't hit those numbers

### **Q2: "What's your PPC budget for the first 6 months?"**
- **Good answer:** $1,500-2,000/month minimum, willing to go higher if seeing traction
- **Bad answer:** $500/month, "let's see how it goes," or "can we do organic only?"
- **Red flag:** Underfunded launch → Products fail due to low budget, you'll be blamed

### **Q3: "What happened with your last Amazon attempt? Why did you lose money?"**
- **Listen for:** Product selection issues (you can fix) vs execution issues (they need to fix)
- **Red flag:** They only blame external factors, no ownership of mistakes

### **Q4: "Do you have budget for professional product photography and A+ Content?"**
- **Good answer:** Yes, budgeted $2K-5K for creative, or have in-house designers
- **Bad answer:** "Can we use factory photos?" or "We'll do it with iPhone"
- **Red flag:** Poor creative → Listings underperform, you'll be blamed

### **Q5: "How much time can your internal team member dedicate to Amazon daily?"**
- **Good answer:** 1-2 hours/day minimum, this is their primary responsibility
- **Bad answer:** "A few hours a week when they have time" or "Consultant will handle it"
- **Red flag:** No one owning execution → Account neglected, you'll be blamed

### **Q6: "What's your timeline expectation for profitability?"**
- **Good answer:** Break-even by month 6-9, profit by month 10-12
- **Bad answer:** "Need profit in 90 days or CFO kills the project"
- **Red flag:** Unrealistic timeline → They'll kill project before it works, you'll be blamed

**⚠️ IF 2+ RED FLAGS: Consider walking away. See [REALITY_CHECK_Expectations.md](REALITY_CHECK_Expectations.md) for "Walk Away" script.**

---

**PRIORITY 2: UNDERSTAND ECOMEXPERTS (After qualifying Todd)**

**You MUST ask these questions to understand what you're dealing with:**

### **1. "What does EcomExperts' proposal include?"**
- Listen for: Product validation? Or just execution (PPC, listings)?
- Listen for: Monthly fee amount ($2K? $3K? $5K?)
- Listen for: Contract length (3 months? 6 months? 12 months?)

### **2. "Is their focus on strategy/coaching, or hands-on execution?"**
- If strategy only → You overlap more (competitive)
- If execution only → You're complementary (validate, they execute)
- If both → Find out where they're weak (probably Canada-specific stuff)

### **3. "Do they have Amazon.ca experience, or are they primarily US-focused?"**
- If Canada experience → Emphasize depth of your 11 years in Canada
- If US-only → Emphasize Canada nuances (tax, compliance, competitive landscape)

### **4. "How do you see me fitting in with EcomExperts?"**
- This tells you if Todd wants to choose (competitive) or use both (complementary)
- If choosing → Lead with value comparison
- If using both → Lead with complementary roles

### **5. "Are you leaning toward ongoing support (EcomExperts model) or one-time setup and training (my model)?"**
- This tells you Todd's long-term vision
- If ongoing support → Position Phase 0 as gate before EcomExperts engagement
- If one-time → Position full Phase 0-3 as alternative to EcomExperts

### **6. "What's your biggest concern about working with a US consultant for a Canadian launch?"**
- Plants seeds: Currency, tax differences, Amazon.ca vs .com nuances, time zone
- Opens door for you to emphasize Canada expertise

## ✅ What TO Do

**DO: Position as complementary**
- "We play different roles — I de-risk product selection, they handle execution"
- "Using both makes sense: Canada expertise (me) + ongoing support (them)"

**DO: Ask discovery questions**
- Find out what EcomExperts is offering BEFORE you position against them
- Understand Todd's vision (build internal capability vs outsource long-term)

**DO: Emphasize Canada expertise**
- Amazon.ca nuances (tax, fees, competitive landscape)
- 11 years of Canadian market experience
- This is your differentiator vs US consultant

**DO: Offer flexibility**
- Phase 0 only (then hand off to EcomExperts)
- Phase 0-3 full engagement (alternative to EcomExperts)
- Phase 0 + ongoing light retainer (complement EcomExperts)

**DO: Focus on risk reduction**
- "Phase 0 prevents the $50K mistake"
- "Even the best execution can't save bad product selection"
- "Validate first, execute second"

---

## ❌ What NOT to Do

**DON'T: Trash-talk EcomExperts**
- "They probably don't know Amazon.ca" → Sounds defensive
- "Monthly fees are a ripoff" → Sounds bitter
- "You don't need them, I can do everything" → Sounds desperate

**DON'T: Assume you're competing**
- You might be complementary (you validate, they execute)
- Todd might want both
- Find out first, position second

**DON'T: Get defensive about pricing**
- If Todd says "EcomExperts is cheaper" → Explain different models (apples-to-oranges)
- If Todd says "Why should I pay you AND them?" → Explain complementary roles
- Stay confident in your value

**DON'T: Ignore EcomExperts**
- Todd already mentioned them — if you don't address it, he'll wonder why
- Acknowledge them in your email and on the call
- Show you're collaborative, not territorial

## 🎭 Likely Scenarios & Responses

### **Scenario 1: Todd wants to use both (you + EcomExperts)**

**Todd says:** "I'm thinking of using you for validation, then EcomExperts for ongoing management."

**You say:**
"Perfect. That's a smart structure. Here's how I'd see it working:

**Phase 0 with me (Dec-Jan):**
- Validate all 50+ SKUs, give you GO/HOLD/KILL list
- Lock container order with only validated products
- Hand off GO list to EcomExperts in early Feb

**EcomExperts (Feb onward):**
- Takes validated GO list
- Handles listings, PPC, account management
- You pay their monthly fee for execution

**Optional: I can also train your internal team** (Phase 2) so they can QA EcomExperts' work and eventually take over if you want to build internal capability.

Does that structure make sense?"

---

### **Scenario 2: Todd is price-shopping (you vs EcomExperts)**

**Todd says:** "EcomExperts is $2,500/month. You're $10,500 upfront. That's a big difference."

**You say:**
"Let's compare apples to apples:

**6-month comparison:**
- EcomExperts: $2,500 × 6 = $15,000 (ongoing monthly fees)
- Greg (Phase 0-2): $10,500 + $14K-18K = $24,500-28,500 total (one-time, includes setup + training)

But we're different models:
- **EcomExperts:** Ongoing support (execution-heavy, long-term dependency)
- **Greg:** One-time project (validation + setup + training, then your team owns it)

**12-month comparison:**
- EcomExperts: $2,500 × 12 = $30,000 (monthly fees)
- Greg: $25K-30K total (one-time, no ongoing fees after)

You might need both:
- Me for validation (Phase 0) → $10,500
- EcomExperts for execution → $2,500/month ongoing

Or, just me (Phase 0-3) → $25K-30K, then your team runs it.

What's your long-term vision? Build internal capability, or outsource long-term?"

---

### **Scenario 3: Todd wants to choose (either you OR EcomExperts, not both)**

**Todd says:** "I need to choose between you and EcomExperts. What makes you different?"

**You say:**
"Fair question. Here are the key differences:

**EcomExperts (likely):**
- US-based, primarily US Amazon experience
- Ongoing monthly retainer (execution-focused)
- Strong on PPC management, listing optimization, account management
- Long-term support model

**Greg:**
- Canada-based, 11 years Amazon.ca + US experience
- One-time project model (validation + setup + training)
- Strong on product validation, Canada-specific strategy, team training
- Build internal capability (you own it after my engagement)

**Which is better? Depends on your goal:**
- If you want to outsource long-term → EcomExperts might be better fit
- If you want to build internal capability → I might be better fit
- If you want both (validation + execution) → Using both makes sense

What's your long-term vision?"

---

### **Scenario 4: EcomExperts includes product validation (direct overlap)**

**Todd says:** "EcomExperts includes product validation in their setup."

**You say:**
"Good to know. A few questions:
- Are they validating based on US Amazon data or Canada-specific data?
- Do they factor in Canadian costs (GST/HST, FBA.ca fees, CAD pricing)?
- Do they provide detailed margin modeling with all costs, or high-level recommendations?
- What's their approach to Amazon Retail threats in Canada?

If they're doing Canada-specific validation, you might not need Phase 0 with me. But if they're using US assumptions, you'll want a second opinion focused on the Canadian market.

Also, even if they're doing validation, Phase 0 with me happens BEFORE you commit the $50K container order. That timeline might not align with when EcomExperts onboards you (Feb-March?).

Does that timing work, or do you need validation in December-January before ordering?"

**Frame:** Timing + depth + Canada focus = your differentiation

| **Timeline** | Dec-Feb (before order) | Feb+ (after order?) |
| **Goal** | Build internal capability | Ongoing outsourced support |
| **Cost (6 months)** | $10.5K (Phase 0 only) or $25K-30K (full) | ~$15K-24K ($2.5K-4K/month) |
| **Best for** | Risk reduction, Canada strategy, team training | Ongoing PPC/listings, long-term support |

## 🎯 Your Closing Position

**On the call, close with:**

"Todd, here's how I see it:

**EcomExperts is likely a good fit for ongoing execution and support.** But before you engage them — and before you commit your $50K container order — you need product validation with a Canada-specific lens.

**That's where I come in.**

**Phase 0 with me ($10,500, one-time):**
- Validates all 50+ SKUs for Canadian market (Amazon.ca competition, Canadian costs, Amazon Retail threats)
- Gives you GO/HOLD/KILL list so you only order products that can succeed
- Happens NOW (Dec-Jan) before you lock the order

**Then you decide:**
- Hand validated GO list to EcomExperts for execution
- Continue with me for setup + training (Phase 1-2)
- Use both (me for Canada strategy, EcomExperts for ongoing support)

**Either way, Phase 0 prevents the $50K mistake.** That's the value.

Does that make sense?"
