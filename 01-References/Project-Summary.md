## Key Meeting Notes

### December 18, 2025 - Discovery Meeting

**Main Points:**
- Todd has 33 SKUs selected from 124 total Best Way products
- All products are $50+ retail price point
- Categories: Pool/spa accessories, inflatables, outdoor recreation
- Lost money in previous seasons - now very conservative and risk-averse
- Has new team member (Douae) with supply chain background but limited e-commerce experience
- Wants to BUILD capability, not just outsource the work
- Container order decision needed ASAP for end-March ship date
- Currently has 2 active SKUs (spa filter, bouncer) that need optimization
- NO PPC campaigns currently running

**Client Goals:**
1. Validate which of 33 SKUs to order for first container
2. Train internal team on how to evaluate products
3. Optimize existing 2 SKUs for better performance
4. Build foundation for successful launch when container arrives

**Pain Points:**
- Previous losses created risk aversion
- Tight timeline for container order
- New team member needs training
- Existing listings underperforming (no PPC strategy)

## Decision Rationale

### Why Option C (Hybrid)?
1. **Risk Mitigation:** Greg validates the 15 highest-risk/highest-investment SKUs
2. **Learning Opportunity:** Team learns methodology by doing the remaining 18
3. **Budget Conscious:** Balanced approach at $5,500-$6,250
4. **Timeline Fit:** Can complete within 2-3 weeks for container decision

### Why Add-ons?
1. **Existing Listing Optimization:** Provides immediate learning opportunity and potential revenue improvement
2. **Listing Creation Training:** Prepares team for when 33 SKUs arrive in March

**Total Investment:** $8,500-$11,500 + HST (vs. $12,500 maximum cap)

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Speed:** Container order decision needed within 2-3 weeks
2. **Accuracy:** Can't afford another season of losses - selections must be data-driven
3. **Knowledge Transfer:** Team must understand methodology for future independence
4. **Actionable Deliverables:** Clear go/no-go recommendations with rationale
