**Scope:** 33 SKUs (filtered from 124, $50+ retail threshold)

---

## PHASE 1: PRODUCT SELECTION & FOUNDATION
*Immediate Focus - Next 60 Days*

I'm proposing three options for the initial engagement, designed to give you flexibility based on your budget, timeline, and learning objectives. You can also add optional services for your existing listings.

## OPTION A: FULL PRODUCT ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS
*"Done-For-You" Expert Analysis*

### What's Included:

✓ Profitability projections based on your landed costs
✓ Detailed recommendations on which SKUs to order and in what quantities
✓ Risk assessment for each product category
✓ Final prioritized SKU list with supporting data and rationale

### Deliverables:

1. Comprehensive 33-SKU analysis report with recommendations
2. Profitability projections spreadsheet
3. Risk assessment matrix
4. Final recommended SKU list with quantities

### Investment:

**Estimated Time:** 35-40 hours

### Best For:

- You need expert-vetted recommendations quickly for urgent container decision
- Todd has minimal time to invest personally
- Want highest confidence in product selection from day one

### Important Project Disclaimer

**All time estimates are based on typical project complexity at the time of this proposal.** Actual hours may vary significantly depending on:

**This is a new product line with inherent risks and unknowns.** I reserve the right to review scope and pricing once the project begins and actual requirements become clearer.

**Important:** The maximum caps are firm limits under all normal circumstances. If extraordinary situations arise where work might approach or require exceeding these maximums, I will:
- Proactively communicate this to you before reaching the cap

The maximum caps protect you from unexpected costs while ensuring fair billing for work performed.
