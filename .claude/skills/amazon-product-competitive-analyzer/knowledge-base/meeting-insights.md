## Todd's Decision Criteria

### Margin Requirements
- **16% margin** = Good for established items (preferred target)
- **15% margin** = Minimum acceptable (validated by 15-product analysis)
- **Below 15%** = Not viable for ongoing business
- **Exception:** New launches may go negative initially (ACoS 60%, TACoS 30%) if market validated
- **Recovery timeline:** Transition from paid to organic over 60-90 days

### Price Point Preferences
- **Primary target:** $50+ retail price points
- **Rationale:** Better profitability, less competition at higher price points
- **Lower prices:** Attract more sellers (lower barriers to entry)
- **Validation:** Retail sales data from Canadian Tire, Walmart strongly weighted

### Risk Tolerance
- Willing to accept negative margins temporarily for aggressive launches
- Requires data validation before investment
- Prioritizes data-driven decisions over arbitrary factory deadlines
- Avoids repeating past mistakes (3-year unprofitable inflatable castle venture)
- Insurance costs major concern (trampolines, children's inflatables problematic)

### Strategic Priorities
1. **Supply chain consistency** over quick wins (must maintain stock)
2. **Year-round items** over pure seasonal (deeper inventory safer)
3. **FBA over FBM** (critical for buy box, 60% success factor)
4. **Brand exclusivity** via Amazon Brand Registry (protect pricing)
5. **Retail relationships** valued (B2B Amazon Business opportunity)

## Product Viability Patterns

### Volume Economics (Critical Learning)
- **Small batch (24 units):** High per-unit landed cost → unacceptable margins
- **Full container (700 units):** ~50% reduction in per-unit cost → viable margins
- **Freight allocation method matters:**
  - **Cubic volume:** Penalizes bulky items
  - **Flat rate:** $3,500 ÷ 700 = $5/unit (dramatically improves bulky item margins)
  - **Recommendation:** Use flat rate for mixed small containers

### Success Indicators
1. **Supply gap in market** (Pump Filter: strong opportunity)
2. **Existing listing with reviews** (106 reviews @ 4.6 stars = credibility)
3. **Weak competitor listings** (poor SEO, weak images = opportunity)
4. **Brand recognition** (Coleman $5M/year validates market)
5. **Complementary to existing sales** (pump for pools already sold)
6. **Destination purchase** (customers seek specific item)

### Failure Indicators
1. **Brand approval blocked** (Coleman: cannot proceed without authorization)
2. **Highly competitive market** (few brands dominate)
3. **Pricing disadvantage** (competitors have built-in features we lack)
4. **Insurance prohibitive** (trampolines require $5M liability)
5. **Wrong voltage/specification** (110v vs 220v critical)
6. **Stockout risk** (kills algorithm recognition, very hard to recover)

## Amazon-Specific Learnings

### FBA vs FBM
- **FBA strongly favored** by Amazon algorithm for buy box
- **Prime eligibility** critical competitive advantage
- **FBM listings:** Lower buy box win rate, lower conversion
- **Strategy:** Convert FBM listings to FBA for 60% improvement (Product 58498 pattern)

### Ranking Dynamics
- **First page (top 10) captures ~90% of sales**
- **Position 1-3:** ~60% of clicks
- **Position 4-10:** ~30% of clicks
- **Beyond page 1:** Minimal traffic (<2%)
- **Mobile users:** Especially unlikely to scroll deep

### Honeymoon Period (Critical for New Launches)
- **Duration:** 60-90 days of extra traffic
- **Purpose:** Amazon gathers performance data on new listings
- **Strategy:** Heavy initial marketing investment to capitalize
- **When to create new vs use existing:**
  - Existing listing with good reviews (106+) → optimize and use
  - Existing listing abandoned/poor quality → create new with new UPC
  - No existing listing → launch new and capitalize on honeymoon

### Keyword Strategy
- **Keywords are fundamental** to entire Amazon ecosystem
- **Title:** Most important (highest weight)
- **Bullet points:** Secondary important
- **Description:** Supporting
- **Not just for PPC:** Organic search, algorithm, customer discovery
- **Canada vs US:** 10x smaller search volumes, proportionally less competition

### Visual Presentation
- **Photos communicate value** better than specs
- **Parents see:** Construction quality, safety features, adjustability in images
- **Justifies premium pricing** more than spec sheets
- **Listing optimization:** Prioritize high-quality images showing differentiation

### Stockout Prevention
- **Never run out of inventory** - kills keyword ranking
- **Algorithm stops recognizing listing** when out of stock
- **Very hard to reestablish position**
- **Strategy:** Maintain continuous inventory even in small quantities
- **Advantage:** Ability to order 24 units keeps high-ticket items active

---

## Seasonality Patterns

### Pool Equipment (70-80% of sales May-August)
- **Peak season:** May-August
- **Off-season strategy:** Keep listings active, limited advertising 2-4 weeks before peak
- **Purpose:** "Spark" algorithm, maintain recognition
- **Inventory approach:** Bring less inventory for pure summer items, minimize investment until validated

### Year-Round Items
- **Inventory strategy:** Go deeper, safer investment
- **Algorithm benefit:** Maintains keyword recognition continuously
- **Preferred by Todd:** Lower risk profile

### Launch Timing
- **April launch ideal** for seasonal products (ahead of May-August peak)
- **Chinese New Year impact:** February affects production scheduling
- **Container timing:** Critical to hit seasonal window

## Competitive Analysis Methodology

### Data Dive Best Practices
- **Dive credits:** 1,000/month maximum, use strategically
- **Ideal competitor count:** 10-15 for Canadian market (7-15 minimum)
- **Hero keyword:** Use for focused apples-to-apples comparison
- **Competitor strength classification:**
  - Very Strong: 96%+ keywords on page 1, thousands of reviews
  - Strong: Well-established, good performance
  - Moderate: Average, room for competition
  - Weak: Poor listings, limited optimization
- **Look for gaps:** Blank keyword fields = opportunity to rank

### Opportunity Identification
- **Weak competitor listings:** Poor images, inadequate descriptions, limited keywords
- **Wrong audience targeting:** Adult vs kids products mislabeled
- **Supply gaps:** Specific items unavailable in market
- **Premium construction:** Better features justify higher prices (adjustable handrests, better padding)
- **Brand name poor execution:** Big brands (Little Tikes) with terrible Amazon SEO

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Multi-Channel Management
- **Walmart 2P price conflicts** with Amazon pricing
- **Strategy:** Use coupons to lower customer price without changing list price
- **Benefit:** Win buy box while maintaining price parity with Canadian Tire/Walmart
- **Important:** Protect retail relationships
- **Coupon mechanics:** Amazon calculates fees on post-coupon price, $0.60 coupon fee per transaction

### Competitive Positioning
- **Average market price** as anchor (e.g., $110 for trampolines)
- **Cheap competitors** ($60-80) create pricing floor
- **Premium justified** by visible quality (photos show construction, safety features)
- **High-ticket items** ($249 pump filter) viable if supply gap exists
- **Canadian Tire pricing** used as reference (Amazon may penalize if significantly higher)

---

## Market Dynamics

### Amazon Canada vs US
- **Population:** ~38M (Canada) vs ~330M (US) = 10x difference
- **Search volumes:** ~10% of US equivalent
- **Traffic:** 250 units/month (Canada) vs 1,200 units/month (US) typical
- **Competition:** Generally less than US (not all US sellers active in Canada)
- **Opportunity:** Less competition but smaller market

### Chinese Seller Competition
- **Market share:** 50%+ of third-party sellers
- **DDP shipments:** Undervalue or reclassify to avoid tariffs
- **Pricing pressure:** Creates unfair advantage for legitimate sellers
- **Challenge:** Operating above board costs more

---

## Logistics and Freight

### Shipping Methods
- **DDP (Delivered Duty Paid):** Factory handles freight and duties to 3PL
- **DAP (Delivered at Place):** Separate payment for duties and customs
- **Best Way limitation:** Cannot ship DDP (not KARM-registered)
- **Todd/Douae:** Properly set up with KARM for customs

### Container Economics
- **40ft high cube:** $5,800 (recent quote)
- **20ft standard:** Quote pending
- **FCL vs LCL:** Even half of 20ft container sometimes cheaper than LCL
- **Capacity example:** ~700 units of trampolines in full container
- **Cost allocation:** Flat rate ($5/unit) vs cubic volume (varies by item)

### 3PL and Fulfillment
- **Partner:** Triumph Logistics (Etobicoke)
- **Customs broker:** CH Robinson
- **Amazon fulfillment:** UPS (Amazon preferred partner)
- **FBA critical:** Must allocate funds for FBA conversion to win buy box

## Business Model Insights

### Wholesale vs Private Label
- **Lower MOQ:** Few hundred units vs thousands
- **Faster market entry:** No custom development
- **Numbers work more easily:** Lower initial investment
- **Critical challenge:** Must maintain reliable replenishment
- **Risk:** Stockouts after building momentum

### Brand Registry Importance
- **Best Way shutting down** unauthorized sellers in US and Canada
- **Official listings** can lock down brand exclusivity
- **Prevents:** Price undercutting by unauthorized sellers
- **Process:** Requires trademark registration and brand approval

### B2B Amazon Business Opportunity
- **Small retail customers** can order via Amazon Business
- **Benefits:** External traffic (Amazon rewards with better organic ranking)
- **Maintains:** Retail relationships while creating revenue channel
- **Tracking:** Affiliate links available

## Product Selection Logic

### Todd's 120-Item Initial Selection
1. **New products for 2026** - Get ahead of retail cycle
2. **Complementary products** - Known demand (pump for pools already sold)
3. **Coleman brand products** - Obligation to supply small/medium customers, #1 camping brand

### Validation Approach
- **Retail sales data** validates market ($5M Coleman annual sales not speculation)
- **Competitor revenue** as indicator of actual buying activity
- **Focus on current items** first before expanding SKU count
- **Over 1,000 items** in Best Way catalog (future expansion potential)
- **Private label opportunities** with 10 different factories

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing decisions to meet factory deadlines** (sacrifices thorough validation)
2. **Evaluating viability on small-batch costs** (24 units misleading)
3. **Not factoring full container economics** (700 units changes everything)
4. **Ignoring FBA conversion importance** (60% success factor)
5. **Copying retail categorization** (Amazon is keyword-driven, not department-driven)
6. **Allowing stockouts** (kills algorithm recognition, very hard to recover)
7. **Using cubic freight allocation for bulky items** (flat rate dramatically better)
8. **Underestimating visual presentation** (photos > specs on Amazon)
9. **Not securing brand exclusivity** (unauthorized sellers undercut pricing)
10. **Proceeding without brand approval** (Coleman situation = total blocker)
