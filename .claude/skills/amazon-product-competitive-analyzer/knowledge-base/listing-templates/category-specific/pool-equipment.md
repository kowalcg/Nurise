## Bullet Point Strategy

### Bullet 1: Technical Performance
Focus on filtration capability, flow rate, or chemical effectiveness
- Include specific numbers (microns, GPH, concentration %)
- Compare to OEM or lower-quality alternatives
- Mention water clarity/cleanliness benefits

**Example:**
```
SUPERIOR 50-MICRON FILTRATION: Advanced pleated design captures microscopic
particles including hair, dust, sand, oils, and debris that standard filters
miss. Engineered with trilobal fabric for 3x more surface area than flat filters.
Delivers crystal-clear, sparkling water that's safe and inviting for your family.
Trusted by over 10,000 spa owners for healthier hot tub experiences.
```

### Bullet 2: Compatibility
Critical for pool equipment - customers need exact compatibility
- List ALL compatible brands and models
- Include alternative product codes (Unicel, Filbur, etc.)
- Add dimensions for verification
- Mention universal fit if applicable

**Example:**
```
UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY WITH TOP BRANDS: Works perfectly with Bestway SaluSpa
(all models), Coleman SaluSpa, Lay-Z-Spa, and any inflatable hot tub using
PRB25-IN, Unicel C-4326, or Filbur FC-2375 specifications. Fits models: 90352E,
90353E, Vegas, Miami, Monaco, Coronado. Dimensions: 13-5/16"L x 5"D with
2-1/8" openings. Guaranteed perfect fit or full refund.
```

### Bullet 3: Durability & Construction
Pool equipment gets harsh use - durability is key selling point
- Material quality (polyester weight, plastic grade)
- Heat resistance (for filters/pumps)
- Chemical resistance (if applicable)
- Lifespan vs OEM

**Example:**
```
COMMERCIAL-GRADE CONSTRUCTION FOR EXTENDED LIFE: Built with heavy-duty 4 oz.
polyester fabric and reinforced ABS thermoplastic end caps that withstand 150°F+
heat without warping. Unlike cheap aftermarket filters that fall apart after
one cleaning, ours last 50+ rinse cycles. Antimicrobial coating prevents mold
and mildew between cleanings. Save $200+ annually vs OEM replacements.
```

### Bullet 4: Safety & Certifications
Pool safety is paramount, especially for families
- NSF/ANSI certifications critical
- BPA-free, non-toxic materials
- Child safety features if applicable
