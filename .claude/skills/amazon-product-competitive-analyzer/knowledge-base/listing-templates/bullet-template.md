# Amazon Listing Bullet Points Template

## Purpose
Guide for constructing optimized 5 bullet points (500 chars each) following SOP-304 methodology.

## Critical Rules

### Single Credit Rule
**NEVER repeat title keywords in bullets** - you only get credit once per keyword.

✅ Good: Title has "hot tub filter", bullets use "spa filtration", "pool cartridge", "water cleaning"
❌ Bad: Title has "hot tub filter", bullets repeat "hot tub filter" (zero additional credit)

### Strategy
Each bullet targets **DIFFERENT keyword root** from title to maximize keyword coverage.

## Universal Structure

```
[KEYWORD-RICH HEADING IN CAPS]: [Benefit statement] [Supporting details] [Social proof]
```

## Bullet Distribution Formula

### Bullet 1: PRIMARY BENEFIT + MAIN FEATURE
**Keywords:** Second-most important root (not in title)
**Hook:** Strongest value proposition
**Social proof:** "Trusted by X customers" or rating mention

**Example:**
```

hair, dust, sand, and microscopic debris that standard filters miss. Engineered
with trilobal fabric and dirt-locking technology for crystal-clear water every
time. Trusted by over 10,000 spa owners for cleaner, healthier hot tub
experiences.

Characters: 324/500 ✓
Keywords: "filtration technology", "50-micron", "pleated", "crystal-clear water"
Ranking Juice: ~640,000 (2x multiplier)
```

### Bullet 2: COMPATIBILITY + EASE OF USE
**Keywords:** Compatibility-related terms

### Bullet 3: DURABILITY + COST-EFFECTIVENESS

## Character Limits

- **Maximum:** 500 characters per bullet
- **Optimal:** 350-450 characters (leaves room for edits)
- **Minimum:** 200 characters (too short = wasted opportunity)

## Formatting Rules

### DO:
✅ Start with keyword-rich heading in CAPS
✅ Use benefits-focused language ("You get..." not "This has...")
✅ Include specific numbers and data
✅ Add social proof where relevant
✅ End with call-to-action or reinforcement

### DON'T:
❌ Repeat title keywords
❌ Use all caps for entire bullet (heading only)
❌ Include promotional claims without substance
❌ Exceed 500 characters
❌ Use emojis or special characters (Amazon may reject)

## Ranking Juice Calculation

```
Bullet Ranking Juice = Σ (Search Volume × 2.0 × Match Type Multiplier)

Position Multiplier: 2.0 (bullets)
Match Type Multipliers:
- Exact: 3.0
- Exact Plural: 2.5
- Broad: 1.5
- Broad Plural: 1.0

Example:
Keyword: "universal compatibility"
Search Volume: 8,000
Match Type: Exact (in bullet heading)
Ranking Juice = 8,000 × 2.0 (bullet position) × 3.0 (exact match) = 48,000
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Repeating Title Keywords:**
Title: "Type VI Hot Tub Filter"
Bullet: "TYPE VI HOT TUB FILTER QUALITY" ← Zero credit!

❌ **Feature Lists Without Benefits:**
"Made with polyester, has ABS caps, 50 micron" ← So what?
Better: "Lasts 50+ cycles thanks to heavy-duty polyester and reinforced caps"

❌ **All Caps Everything:**
"PREMIUM FILTER WITH BEST QUALITY EVER MADE" ← Looks spammy

❌ **Vague Claims:**
"High quality filter" ← Not specific
Better: "4 oz. polyester with reinforced ABS caps"

❌ **Exceeding Character Limits:**
501+ characters = Amazon may truncate or reject
