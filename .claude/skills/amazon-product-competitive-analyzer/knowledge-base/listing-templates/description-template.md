# Amazon Listing Description Template

## Purpose
Guide for constructing optimized 2,000-character Amazon product descriptions following SOP-304 methodology.

## Critical Rules

### Single Credit Rule (Still Applies!)
**NEVER repeat title or bullet keywords in description** - you only get credit once per keyword.

Use description for:
1. Remaining MKL keywords NOT in title or bullets
2. Long-tail keyword variations
3. SEO-optimized storytelling
4. Detailed compatibility lists
5. Technical specifications

professional-grade filtration performance at an affordable price.

COMPLETE COMPATIBILITY
These universal spa filters work seamlessly with all major inflatable hot tub
brands and models including: Bestway SaluSpa (Vegas, Miami, Monaco, Coronado,
Palm Springs, Helsinki), Coleman (all SaluSpa models), Lay-Z-Spa (all models),
and any spa using PRB25-IN, Unicel C-4326, Filbur FC-2375, or equivalent Type
VI filter specifications. Also compatible with model numbers: 90352E, 90353E,

dimensions: 13-5/16" length, 5" diameter, 2-1/8" top and bottom holes.

PREMIUM CONSTRUCTION & PERFORMANCE
Each filter cartridge features heavy-duty 4 oz. polyester fabric pleated to
25 sq.ft filtration area for maximum debris capture. Reinforced ABS thermoplastic
end caps withstand heat up to 150°F without warping or melting - a common problem
with cheaper aftermarket alternatives. Our advanced trilobal filtration fabric
traps particles as small as 50 microns (finer than human hair) including dust,
sand, oils, and microscopic contaminants. Integrated strengthened core prevents
collapse during high-flow operation. Antimicrobial coating resists mold and
mildew growth between cleanings.

QUALITY YOU CAN TRUST
Manufactured in ISO 9001 certified facilities using BPA-free, NSF/ANSI approved
materials safe for families and sensitive skin. Each filter undergoes rigorous
quality testing including flow rate verification, structural integrity checks,
and filtration efficiency analysis before shipping. Unlike generic imports, our
filters meet North American pool and spa safety standards. Enjoy peace of mind
knowing your spa water is filtered through certified, premium-quality materials.

- **Minimum:** 1,500 characters (too short = wasted opportunity)
- **Sections can flex:** Compatibility can be 600, Features 400 if needed

## Keyword Placement Strategy

```
For each remaining MKL keyword:
  1. Check if in title → Skip
  2. Check if in bullets → Skip
  3. Check if broad match can become exact → Priority
  4. Integrate naturally into appropriate section:
     - Benefit keywords → Opening
     - Compatibility keywords → Compatibility section
     - Technical keywords → Features section
     - Safety keywords → Quality section
     - Support keywords → Guarantee section
  5. Calculate ranking juice (1x multiplier)
```

## Ranking Juice Calculation

```
Description Ranking Juice = Σ (Search Volume × 1.0 × Match Type Multiplier)

Position Multiplier: 1.0 (description)
Match Type Multipliers:
- Exact: 3.0
- Exact Plural: 2.5
- Broad: 1.5
- Broad Plural: 1.0

Example:
Keyword: "universal spa filters"
Search Volume: 3,500
Match Type: Exact (in description)
Ranking Juice = 3,500 × 1.0 (description) × 3.0 (exact match) = 10,500
```

## Formatting Tips

### DO:
✅ Use section headers (CAPS) for scannability
✅ Write in paragraphs (easier to read than bullet lists)
✅ Include specific numbers and data
✅ Tell a story (opening → features → trust → action)
✅ Use natural language (not keyword stuffing)

### DON'T:
❌ Repeat title or bullet keywords
❌ Use promotional language ("BEST EVER!", "AMAZING!")
❌ Include pricing information (changes frequently)
❌ Add competitor comparisons (Amazon may flag)
❌ Exceed 2,000 characters

## Optimization Checklist

Before finalizing description:
- [ ] Character count: 1,900-2,000 (optimal range)
- [ ] NO repetition of title/bullet keywords
- [ ] All 5 sections present
- [ ] 15-25 new keywords added
- [ ] Section headers used (CAPS)
- [ ] Technical specifications included
- [ ] Compatibility details comprehensive
- [ ] Certifications/safety mentioned
- [ ] Guarantee/support details clear
- [ ] Call-to-action at end
- [ ] Total description ranking juice >800K

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Keyword Repetition:**
Title + Bullets already used "hot tub filter", don't waste description space
repeating it

❌ **Keyword Stuffing:**
"Filter filter filters filtering filtration filter system" ← Looks spammy

❌ **Too Short:**
Only using 1,000 characters when you have 2,000 available = wasted opportunity

❌ **No Structure:**
Wall of text with no section breaks = hard to scan

❌ **Missing Technical Specs:**
Customers need dimensions, materials, capacity details
