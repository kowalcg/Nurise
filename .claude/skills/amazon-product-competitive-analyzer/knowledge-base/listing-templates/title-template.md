# Amazon Listing Title Template

## Purpose
Guide for constructing optimized 200-character Amazon listing titles following SOP-304 methodology.

## Universal Formula

```
{Brand} {Product Type} {Size/Qty} | {Feature 1} {Feature 2} |
{Compatibility 1}, {Compatibility 2} | {Differentiator}
```

## Construction Rules

### 1. Front-Load High-Volume Keywords (First 50 chars)
- First 50 characters carry most weight
- Place highest search volume exact match keywords first
- Brand name typically goes first (unless keyword volume dictates otherwise)

### 2. Use Exact Match Keywords
✅ Good: "type vi hot tub filter"
❌ Bad: "filter for hot tub type vi"

Exact match = 3.0x multiplier
Broad match = 1.5x multiplier
**Gain: 2x more ranking juice**

### 3. Include Top 5-7 Keyword Roots
- Don't just use variations of one keyword
- Spread across different roots for broader coverage
- Example roots:
  - Root 1: "type vi"
  - Root 2: "hot tub filter"
  - Root 3: "spa filter cartridge"
  - Root 4: "bestway"
  - Root 5: "coleman saluspa"

### 4. Character Limit
- Amazon.ca: 200 characters max
- Amazon.com: 250 characters max
- Truncate lowest-value keywords if exceeded

### 5. Readability Check
- Must flow naturally to human readers
- No obvious keyword stuffing
- Benefits should be clear
- Use pipes "|" to separate sections for scannability

| Feature 2 | Medium | "50 Micron Filtration" | Secondary feature |
| Compatibility 1 | High | "for Bestway Coleman SaluSpa" | Critical for search |
| Compatibility 2 | Medium | "Lay-Z-Spa Inflatable" | Additional models |

## Optimization Checklist

Before finalizing title:
- [ ] Character count ≤200 (Amazon.ca) or ≤250 (Amazon.com)
- [ ] Top 5-7 keyword roots included
- [ ] Exact match keywords (not broad)
- [ ] Highest volume keywords in first 50 characters
- [ ] Flows naturally when read aloud
- [ ] No keyword stuffing appearance
- [ ] Brand name included
- [ ] Product type clear and specific
- [ ] Size/quantity mentioned if applicable

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Keyword Stuffing:**
"Filter Hot Tub Pool Spa Filter Tub Filters Hot Tubs Spas Pools Replacement..."

❌ **Broad Match Instead of Exact:**
"Filter for Hot Tub Type VI Coleman" instead of "Type VI Hot Tub Filter for Coleman"

❌ **Wasting Characters on Fluff:**
"Amazing Premium High Quality Best..." (use specific features instead)

❌ **Ignoring Search Volume:**
Placing low-volume keywords first instead of high-volume keywords

❌ **Missing Product Type:**
"6-Pack Replacement for Bestway Coleman" (what product??)

## Ranking Juice Calculation

```
Title Ranking Juice = Σ (Search Volume × 3.0 × Match Type Multiplier)

Match Type Multipliers:
- Exact: 3.0
- Exact Plural: 2.5
- Broad: 1.5
- Broad Plural: 1.0

Example:
Keyword: "type vi hot tub filter"
Search Volume: 12,000
Match Type: Exact (in title)
Ranking Juice = 12,000 × 3.0 (title position) × 3.0 (exact match) = 108,000
```
