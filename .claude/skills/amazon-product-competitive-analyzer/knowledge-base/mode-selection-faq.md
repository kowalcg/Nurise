## General Questions

### Q: What's the difference between Mode 1 and Mode 2?

**A:** Think of it as screening vs. deep-dive:

| Mode 1 (Validation) | Mode 2 (Optimization) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Screen 15+ products** | **Optimize 1 product** |
| **GO/NO-GO decisions** | **Complete Product Brief** |
| **~2.5 min per product** | **~1-2 hours per product** |
| **Comparison table** | **Production-ready listing copy** |
| **No PPC/roadmap** | **Full PPC + 90-day plan** |

**Use Mode 1 first** to identify winners, **then Mode 2** to optimize them.

---

### Q: Can I run Mode 1, then Mode 2 on the winners?

**A:** Yes! This is the recommended workflow for new product batches:

**Step 1:** Run Mode 1 on 18 products
```
"Analyze these 18 products for validation"
```
**Output:** Comparison table → 6 GO, 7 MAYBE, 5 NO-GO

**Step 2:** Select top winners from GO products

**Step 3:** Run Mode 2 on specific products
```
"Now create Product Brief for Product #58498"
"Optimize listing for Product #61829"
```
**Output:** Complete Product Briefs for selected products

**Total time:** ~45 min (Mode 1) + 2-4 hours (Mode 2 for 2 products)

---

### Q: I have 5 products - which mode should I use?

**A:** The skill will ask you to clarify. Choose based on your goal:

**Option A: Validation (Mode 1)**
- Goal: Screen 5 to pick the best 1-2
- Output: Comparison table ranking all 5
- Next step: Launch top-ranked products

**Option B: Optimization (Mode 2)**
- Goal: Deep dive + listing copy for each of 5
- Output: 5 complete Product Briefs
- Time: ~5-10 hours total (1-2 hours each)

**Most common:** Run Mode 1 first (screen 5 → pick top 2) → then Mode 2 on winners.

---

## Mode 1 (Validation) Questions

### Q: What's the minimum number of products for Mode 1?

**A:** Technically 1, but Mode 1 is designed for batches:

- **15+ products:** Automatic Mode 1 detection
- **5-14 products:** Skill asks for clarification
- **1-4 products:** Skill suggests Mode 2 (unless you explicitly request Mode 1)

**Optimal:** 15-50 products for meaningful comparison.

---

### Q: Do I need DataDive exports for Mode 1?

**A:** Not required, but helpful:

✅ **With DataDive:** Richer competitive analysis, better scoring
✅ **Without DataDive:** Still works using:
- SmartScout ASINs (from your spreadsheet)
- Historical patterns from knowledge base
- Category benchmarks

**Recommendation:** For your top 5 GO candidates, add DataDive for better validation.

---

### Q: How long does Mode 1 take?

**A:** ~2.5 minutes per product:

- 15 products: ~37 minutes
- 20 products: ~50 minutes
- 30 products: ~75 minutes
- 50 products: ~125 minutes (~2 hours)

**Note:** First run may take longer as skill loads knowledge base.

---

### Q: What if I want listing copy for all 18 products?

**A:** You have two options:

**Option A: Combined Mode** (batch listing generation)
```
"Analyze these 18 products AND create listings for all GO products"
```
- Runs Mode 1 (screen 18)
- Auto-triggers Mode 2 for GO-rated products only
- Time: Mode 1 time + (Mode 2 time × # of GO products)

**Option B: Sequential** (more control)
```
Step 1: "Analyze these 18 products" (Mode 1)
Step 2: Review results, select 3 winners
Step 3: "Create Product Brief for Product A, B, C" (Mode 2 × 3)
```

**Recommendation:** Option B (more control over which get full optimization).

---

## Mode 2 (Optimization) Questions

### Q: Can I run Mode 2 without competitive data?

**A:** You can, but quality drops significantly:

**Minimum needed:**
- Product ASIN or details
- Cost data (for pricing strategy)
- At least basic keyword research

**Optimal:**
- Full DataDive export (keywords + competitors CSVs)
- Current listing data (if existing product)
- Screenshots of current performance

**Without competitor data:** You'll get generic optimization, not strategic positioning.

---

### Q: How much detail does Mode 2 provide?

**A:** See the [Saluspa Hot Tub Filter example](../../09-Listing-Optimization/Saluspa-Hot-Tub-Filter/) - a typical Mode 2 output includes:

**14 sections, ~50-100 KB:**
1. Executive Summary
2. Product Economics & Validation
3. Competitive Landscape (per-unit pricing, why winners win)
4. Keyword Performance (rankings, gaps, opportunities)
5. Multi-Pack Strategy (if applicable)
6. Optimized Listing Copy (title, bullets, backend keywords)
7. Variation Architecture (2, 4, 8, 12-pack recommendations)
8. Profitability Projections (3 scenarios)
9. A+ Content Strategy (5 module layouts)
10. PPC Campaign Structure (keywords, bids, budgets)
11. 90-Day Roadmap (week-by-week action plan)
12. Risk Analysis (5 major risks + mitigation)
13. Success Metrics (KPIs to track)
14. Implementation Checklist

**This is production-ready output**, not a summary.

---

### Q: Can I use Mode 2 for existing products?

**A:** Absolutely! Mode 2 works for:

✅ **New products** (pre-launch listing creation)
✅ **Existing underperforming products** (optimization + relaunch strategy)
✅ **Existing successful products** (competitive defense, variation expansion)

**Example:** Saluspa filter was an existing product → Mode 2 identified multi-pack opportunity → +211% profit projected.

---

### Q: How do I know if Mode 2's recommendations are good?

**A:** Mode 2 provides:

**Rationale for every recommendation:**
- Why this title structure? (SEO ranking juice explanation)
- Why these bullets? (Keyword coverage + benefit mapping)
- Why multi-pack? (Competitive gap analysis + FBA fee leverage)
- Why this pricing? (Competitor comparison + margin calculations)

**Validation checkpoints:**
- Compare to top 3 competitors (included in analysis)
- Review projected vs. actual metrics (if existing product)
- Test with soft launch (recommended in roadmap)

**Trust but verify:** Use Mode 2 as expert baseline, adjust for brand voice.

---

## Combined Workflow Questions

### Q: Can I run Mode 2 on products that were NO-GO in Mode 1?

**A:** Yes, but ask yourself why:

**Valid reasons:**
- Mode 1 flagged edge case you want to explore
- Market changed since Mode 1 analysis
- Strategic product (even if not profitable)

**Not recommended:**
- Hoping Mode 2 will make NO-GO viable (it won't change fundamentals)
- Just curious (save the 1-2 hours)

**Better approach:** Run Mode 2 on MAYBE products to make final decision.

---

### Q: What if Mode 1 says GO but I want more detail before launch?

**A:** Perfect use case for Mode 2!

**Sequence:**
```
Mode 1: "Product #58498 is GO (score: 8.7, margin: 62%, low competition)"
↓
You: "Sounds promising, but I want to see the full strategy"
↓
Mode 2: "Create Product Brief for Product #58498"
↓
Output: Complete competitive analysis + optimized listing + 90-day plan
↓
Decision: Launch with confidence
```

**Mode 1 identifies winners, Mode 2 creates winning strategies.**

---

### Q: How often should I run each mode?

**Mode 1 frequency:**
- **New supplier evaluation:** Every time you get a new product list
- **Quarterly reviews:** Re-screen catalog for new opportunities
- **On-demand:** When considering adding products

**Mode 2 frequency:**
- **Pre-launch:** Every new product (GO-rated from Mode 1)
- **Quarterly optimization:** Top 20% of catalog (refresh listings)
- **Competitive response:** When competitor makes big move
- **Performance issues:** When product underperforms expectations

---

## Technical Questions

### Q: How does the skill detect which mode to use?

**A:** Multi-signal detection (Phase 1.5 in skill.md):

**Signal 1: Product Count**
- 1 product → Mode 2
- 15+ products → Mode 1
- 2-14 products → Ask for clarification

**Signal 2: Keywords in Request**
- "optimize", "listing", "Product Brief" → Force Mode 2
- "validate", "screen", "which products" → Force Mode 1

**Signal 3: Data Presence**
- Has DataDive exports in /02-Research/ → Suggests Mode 2
- Has product spreadsheet only → Suggests Mode 1

**If ambiguous:** Skill asks "Which workflow do you need?"

---

### Q: Can I override the auto-detection?

**A:** Yes, be explicit in your request:

**Force Mode 1 (even for 1 product):**
```
"Run product validation on this single product"
```

**Force Mode 2 (even for 15 products):**
```
"Create Product Briefs for all 15 products"
(Warning: This will take 15-30 hours)
```

**Recommended:** Trust auto-detection, it's accurate.

---

### Q: What if I run the wrong mode accidentally?

**A:** No problem:

**Ran Mode 1 but wanted Mode 2:**
- Simply request Mode 2 for specific product
- No need to re-run Mode 1
- Example: "Now create Product Brief for Product #58498"

**Ran Mode 2 but wanted Mode 1:**
- Less common (Mode 2 is superset of Mode 1)
- Mode 2 output includes GO/NO-GO decision
- Just ignore the detailed optimization if not needed

**Mode 2 includes Mode 1 analysis** (competitive scoring, GO/NO-GO) **plus** optimization.

## Best Practices

### Q: What's the recommended workflow for a new supplier?

**A:** The "validation → optimization" pipeline:

**Week 1: Screening (Mode 1)**
```
Input: 30 products from new supplier
Action: "Analyze these 30 products for validation"
Output: Comparison table → 8 GO, 12 MAYBE, 10 NO-GO
```

**Week 2: Deep Dive (Mode 2)**
```
Input: Top 3 GO products
Action: "Create Product Brief for Product A, B, C"
Output: 3 complete Product Briefs
```

**Week 3-4: Implementation**
- Set up listings for top 3
- Launch with optimized copy
- Implement PPC campaigns

**Month 2: Monitor & Iterate**
- Track success metrics
- Adjust based on performance
- Consider MAYBE products if winners validate

---

### Q: How do I get the most value from Mode 2?

**A:** Preparation is key:

**Before running Mode 2:**
1. ✅ Validate with Mode 1 (don't waste 2 hours on NO-GO product)
2. ✅ Gather complete competitor data (DataDive exports)
3. ✅ Know your cost structure (COGS, FBA fees)
4. ✅ Review top 3 competitors manually (understand market)
5. ✅ Clarify goals (profit vs. market share, quick launch vs. premium positioning)

**During Mode 2 review:**
1. ✅ Read full Product Brief (don't skip sections)
2. ✅ Understand rationale (why each recommendation)
3. ✅ Validate pricing assumptions (market may have changed)
4. ✅ Adapt copy to brand voice (maintain keyword coverage)

**After Mode 2:**
1. ✅ Implement recommendations (don't just collect analysis)
2. ✅ Track metrics weekly (validate projections)
3. ✅ Provide feedback in meeting notes (improve future analyses)

## Troubleshooting

### Q: The skill detected the wrong mode - how do I fix it?

**A:** Be more explicit in your next request:

**Example 1: Wanted Mode 1, got Mode 2**
```
Original: "Analyze this product" (ambiguous)
Corrected: "Run product validation to decide GO/NO-GO"
```

**Example 2: Wanted Mode 2, got Mode 1**
```
Original: "Analyze this product" (ambiguous)
Corrected: "Create complete Product Brief with listing optimization"
```

**Pro tip:** Use the exact trigger phrases from README.md for guaranteed detection.

---

### Q: Mode 1 output doesn't include listing copy - is this a bug?

**A:** No, this is expected! Mode 1 = validation only.

**To get listing copy:** Run Mode 2 on specific products after Mode 1 screening.

**Comparison:**
| What You Want | Correct Mode |
|---------------|--------------|
| GO/NO-GO decision | Mode 1 |
| Listing copy (title, bullets) | Mode 2 |
| PPC campaigns | Mode 2 |
| Both | Run Mode 1 first, then Mode 2 on winners |
